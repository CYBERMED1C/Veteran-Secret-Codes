## VA Health Care

**Overview:** VA Health Care provides comprehensive medical services to eligible veterans, ranging from preventive care and primary care to specialized treatment (including mental health, rehabilitation, and more). All VA medical care is provided either at VA facilities or through approved community providers.

**Eligibility:** Generally, veterans who served in active duty and received any discharge status other than dishonorable qualify for VA health care ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=You%20may%20be%C2%A0eligible%20for%20VA,didn%E2%80%99t%20receive%20a%20dishonorable%20discharge)). Veterans who enlisted after 1980 (or entered active duty after 1981) usually need **24 months of continuous service** or the full period they were called to active duty (with exceptions for early discharge due to service-connected disability, hardship, etc.) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20enlisted%20after%20September,duty%20after%20October%2016%2C%201981)) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=,prior%20to%20September%207%2C%201980)). National Guard and Reserve members qualify if they were federally activated (other than training only) and completed the full period of activation ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20current%20or,the%20Reserves%20or%20National%20Guard)). 

- **Expanded Eligibility:** Recent laws have expanded VA health care to more veterans. For example, **veterans exposed to toxins or hazards (Agent Orange, burn pits, etc.) during service in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq/Afghanistan or other combat zones after 9/11 are now eligible for VA health care** under the PACT Act, even if they don’t have a service-connected condition ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=All%20Veterans%20who%20meet%20basic,Apply%20today)) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20meet%20the%20basic,our%20country%E2%80%94at%20home%20or%20abroad)). Veterans with certain awards or circumstances (e.g. Purple Heart recipients, former POWs, Medal of Honor recipients, those who served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War, Camp Lejeune service, etc.) are given **“enhanced eligibility”** which places them in a higher priority group for care ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=At%20least%20one%20of%20these,must%20be%20true)) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=,if%20you%20were%20never%20deployed)). If a veteran doesn’t fall into a special category, **income-based** criteria may apply – VA will assess household income to determine if the veteran qualifies for free or reduced-cost care ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20none%20of%20these%20descriptions,care%20based%20on%20your%20income)).

- **Priority Groups:** Once enrolled, veterans are assigned to a priority group (1–8) based on factors like service-connected disability rating, income, and other special statuses. For instance, veterans with **service-connected disabilities rated 50% or higher (or 100% unemployable)** are Priority Group 1 and receive care with no copays ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=100%20percent%20Disabled%20Veterans%20meet,the%20highest%20priority%20group%20available)). Veterans receiving a VA pension or who are Medicaid-eligible also get higher priority. Lower priority groups include higher-income veterans without service disabilities; they may have copays for some care. 

- **Other-Than-Honorable Discharges:** Veterans with an **OTH or bad conduct discharge** are typically not eligible for VA health benefits, but **VA offers pathways for these veterans**. They can apply for a **discharge upgrade** or request a **VA Character of Discharge review** to determine if they can receive benefits despite the discharge status ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=What%20should%20I%20do%20if,bad%20conduct%2C%20or%20dishonorable%20discharge)). Additionally, under VA’s mental health initiatives, veterans with OTH discharges can access **emergency mental health care** in crisis situations (see the Mental Health section below).

**Services Covered:** VA health care covers most medically necessary services: inpatient and outpatient treatment, primary care, specialist visits, preventive services (immunizations, screenings), mental health care, prescriptions, and in many cases **dental care** (primarily for 100% disabled or those with service-connected dental issues). VA also provides **hearing aids and eyeglasses** for certain qualifying veterans (such as those with compensable disabilities). **Long-term care**, skilled nursing, and home health aides are provided for eligible veterans (usually those with significant service-connected disabilities or low income/pension). Additionally, VA offers **geriatric and extended care programs**, telehealth services, **women’s health services** (including maternity care and reproductive health), and specialty programs for conditions like spinal cord injury, blindness, etc.

- **Family and Caregiver Support:** Veterans’ family members may also benefit from certain programs. Notably, the **Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC)** provides training, support, mental health services, respite care, and a **monthly stipend** to qualifying caregivers of seriously injured veterans. This program is generally for caregivers of veterans with severe service-connected injuries who need personal care assistance (originally for post-9/11 veterans, now expanded to all eras) ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=You%20may%20qualify%20for%20VA,Comprehensive%20Assistance%20for%20Family%20Caregivers)). There is also the **VA Caregiver Support Program** which any veteran caregiver (of any era) can access for resources and training (even if not eligible for the stipend program).

- **CHAMPVA for Dependents:** While not part of VA health care enrollment, it’s worth noting here that **certain spouses, children, and survivors** of veterans can get health coverage through **CHAMPVA** (Civilian Health and Medical Program of VA). **CHAMPVA is typically for dependents of veterans who are rated 100% permanently and totally disabled due to service, or who died either in service or from a service-connected condition (and are not eligible for TRICARE) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=CHAMPVA%20is%20available%20to%20dependents,any%20of%20the%20following%20criteria))**. Under CHAMPVA, VA shares the cost of most medical services and supplies for these family members.

**How to Enroll:** To apply for VA health care, veterans must submit an **Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ)**. This can be done in multiple ways: 

- **Online:** Through the VA’s website by filling out the 10-10EZ form online at VA.gov.  
- **By Phone:** Call the VA Health Care enrollment hotline at **877-222-VETS (877-222-8387)** (M-F, 8AM–8PM ET) to apply or ask questions ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=,phone)). 
- **By Mail:** Fill out the paper 10-10EZ form and mail it to the Health Eligibility Center (address is on the form) ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=,mail)) ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=Send%20your%20completed%20application%20here%3A)). 
- **In Person:** Visit any VA Medical Center or clinic, obtain a 10-10EZ, fill it out and submit it on site ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=,person)). 
- **With a VSO:** An accredited Veterans Service Officer can also assist with the application ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=,help%20of%20a%20trained%20professional)).

When applying, be prepared to provide your **discharge documentation (DD214)**, **social security numbers** for yourself and dependents, and **financial information** (income, assets, expenses) if you believe you might fall into an income-based category ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20need%20this%20information%3A)) ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=includes%20Medicare%2C%20private%20insurance%2C%20or,health%20care%20and%20education%20costs)). (Financial disclosure is not required if you have another qualifying eligibility, but if you don’t, reporting income can help VA determine if you qualify based on **means testing** ([How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/#:~:text=Note%3A%C2%A0You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20tell,information%20to%20decide%C2%A0on%20your%20application)).)

**Costs:** **VA health care is not insurance, but an earned benefit.** Many veterans receive care **with no monthly premiums**, and **no copays** for service-connected conditions. For non-service-connected care, some veterans have small copays (often waived if the veteran is low-income, has a service-connected rating, or is in a higher priority group). There are **no deductibles** for VA care. **Medications** may have a copay for some veterans, but those with service-connected disabilities (50% or higher) or low income are typically exempt. VA also limits medication copays with an annual cap for veterans in certain priority groups ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=,Gulf%20War)). 

**Using VA Health Care:** Once enrolled, you will be assigned a **VA medical center** (and a primary care provider). You can **schedule appointments** directly with the VA facility or online through the **MyHealtheVet patient portal**. VA also offers a growing telehealth program (for primary care and mental health especially). If the VA cannot provide a certain service or if wait times are long or distance is far, you may be able to use **VA’s Community Care Program**, where VA authorizes you to see an outside provider at VA’s expense (eligibility for community care depends on specific criteria like wait times, drive times, or services unavailable in VA) ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=,we%20reviewed%20your%20case%20before)) ([VA Mental Health Services | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20schedule%20my,first%20appointment)).

**Hidden Tips & Additional Info:**

- **Immediate Coverage for New Separations:** Under the **“Combat Veteran” authority, recently separated veterans who served in a combat theater have *enhanced eligibility***. For example, **combat veterans get 5 years of free VA health care for any condition** (regardless of income) after discharge. This is especially useful for OEF/OIF/OND veterans. The PACT Act extended that benefit to **10 years for post-9/11 combat veterans** and offered a one-time special enrollment period for Vietnam and Gulf War era veterans who missed earlier enrollment opportunities ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=All%20Veterans%20who%20meet%20basic,Apply%20today)) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20meet%20the%20basic,our%20country%E2%80%94at%20home%20or%20abroad)).

- **Priority Group 6 for Vietnam and Toxic Exposure:** Veterans who served in Vietnam, Gulf War, or post-9/11 combat are assigned to at least Priority Group 6 due to presumptive exposures (Agent Orange, burn pits, etc.), granting them free VA health care for life for any condition ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=All%20Veterans%20who%20meet%20basic,Apply%20today)) ([Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20meet%20the%20basic,our%20country%E2%80%94at%20home%20or%20abroad)).

- **No Need for Other Insurance:** VA health care meets the standards for minimum essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Veterans who use VA care do not need to buy private insurance to avoid insurance penalties. (However, veterans can have both VA and private insurance/Medicare; VA will bill private insurance for non-service care if you have it, but **VA is the primary safety net** even if uninsured.)

- **Travel Reimbursement:** Eligible veterans (those with service-connected ratings ≥30% or certain low-income vets) can get reimbursed for mileage or provided special transport (like ambulatory or wheelchair transportation) for travel to VA appointments ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,Vision%20care%20and%20hearing%20aids)) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=This%20applies%20to%20disabled%20veterans,receive%20completely%20free%20VA%20care)). This **Beneficiary Travel** benefit can help cover the cost of gas or public transportation.

- **VA “Welcome Kit”:** The VA publishes a *Welcome Kit* that includes a guide on health care enrollment and what to expect. This can be a useful reference for new enrollees, explaining how to find a provider, make appointments, and understand your benefits.

## VA Disability Compensation and Ratings

**Overview:** **VA Disability Compensation** is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to veterans who have a medical condition or injury that was caused or aggravated by their military service. These can include **physical injuries, chronic illnesses, or mental health conditions (like PTSD)** that began in service or as a result of service ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=VA%20disability%20compensation%20,Veterans%20disability%20benefits%20you%E2%80%99ve%20earned)). The amount of compensation depends on the **disability rating** assigned by VA, which reflects the severity of the condition (from 0% to 100% in 10% increments). A higher combined rating yields a higher monthly payment, and certain ratings (30% or higher) also qualify for additional allowances for dependents.

**Eligibility:** To receive VA disability compensation, a veteran generally must show **three elements**: (1) evidence of a current diagnosed disability, (2) evidence of an event, injury, or illness in service (or that a condition began or was aggravated during service), and (3) a **nexus** linking the current disability to the in-service cause (often established by medical opinion). Some conditions are presumed to be service-connected for certain veterans (for example, if you served in Vietnam, certain diseases like diabetes or ischemic heart disease are presumed due to Agent Orange exposure, eliminating the need to prove the nexus). As long as your discharge is not dishonorable and you have a service-connected condition, you can apply. Even **reservists or Guard members** can receive compensation if injured during qualified active duty or training periods.

**Disability Ratings:** VA assigns a percentage rating to each service-connected condition. This rating is based on criteria in the **VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD)**, which evaluates how much the condition impairs average earning capacity. Ratings range from **0%** (acknowledged as service-connected but not disabling enough to warrant payment) up to **100%** (totally disabling). **Monthly compensation payments start at 10%** (a 0% rating yields no monthly payment but can qualify you for other benefits like VA health care or a higher priority group). If a veteran has multiple rated conditions, VA uses a **combined ratings table** (not straight addition) to calculate an overall combined rating. For example, a 30% and a 20% rating don’t simply add to 50% – instead the formula would yield 44% which rounds down to 40%. The combined rating is then rounded to the nearest 10%. 

- **Compensation Amounts:** The **monthly payment** increases with the rating. As of late 2024, a single veteran rated 100% receives over $3,600 per month, whereas a 10% rating is about $165 per month. Veterans rated **30% or higher** receive additional allowances for dependents (spouse, children, dependent parents) on top of the base rate. VA updates compensation rates annually (usually an adjustment based on COLA). Current and past rate tables are published on VA’s website ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=,your%20disability%20rating%20and%20dependents)).

- **Permanent and Total (P&T):** Some veterans are rated 100% “permanent and total,” meaning their disabilities are not expected to improve. P&T status entitles veterans to additional benefits (like Chapter 35 DEA for dependents, CHAMPVA for spouse/kids, no future routine exams scheduled). It also often results in state-level benefits (which we won’t cover here).

**How to Apply (Filing a Claim):** Veterans typically initiate a claim by submitting **VA Form 21-526EZ** (Application for Disability Compensation) – this can be done online via **VA.gov or eBenefits**, or by mailing the form to the VA regional claims intake center, or with the help of an accredited VSO. Key steps:

1. **Gather Evidence:** Include any relevant **service treatment records**, private medical records, and lay statements. VA has a **duty to assist** in obtaining federal records and will often schedule a **Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam** to evaluate your claimed conditions.

2. **File an Intent to File (optional but recommended):** If you need time to gather evidence, you can file an **Intent to File** which sets a protective date. You then have 1 year to submit the full claim; if granted, benefits will backdate to the intent to file date.

3. **Submit the Claim:** You can apply online through [VA.gov’s disability compensation portal】 or [ebenefits.va.gov]. Alternatively, file by mail or in person with VA Form 21-526EZ. You can also work with a **Veterans Service Organization (VSO)** like DAV, VFW, American Legion, etc., who have accredited representatives to help you prepare and submit the claim **free of charge** ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=what%20to%20do%20after%20you,get%20your%20rating)).

4. **Claim Processing:** VA will review your application, schedule any necessary exams, and then send you a decision packet. Typical processing time for an initial claim can range from a few months to a year depending on complexity and backlog.

**After the Decision – Increasing Ratings and Appeals:** If you receive a rating decision and **disagree** with it (either a denial of a condition or the percentage assigned), or if a service-connected condition **worsens over time**, you have options:

- **File for an Increased Rating:** If a condition has deteriorated since it was last evaluated (e.g. your hearing loss or orthopedic condition has gotten worse), you can file a new claim for **increased compensation** on that condition. Essentially you submit a request for an increase, with any new medical evidence. VA will often schedule a new C&P exam to assess the current severity. This can be done at any time. (Note: If you’re within one year of the original decision, this will be processed slightly differently – see Appeals below.)

- **Appeals/Decision Review:** With the Appeals Modernization Act, veterans have **three avenues to challenge a VA decision** (such as a low rating or denial) within one year of the decision:
  1. **Supplemental Claim** – submit new and relevant evidence and ask VA to reconsider ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=,we%20reviewed%20your%20case%20before)).
  2. **Higher-Level Review (HLR)** – ask for a senior VA rater to review the decision **with no new evidence** allowed; essentially a fresh look, possibly to catch errors ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=%2A%20Ask%20for%20a%20higher,Level%20Review)). You can request an informal phone conference with the higher-level reviewer during an HLR.
  3. **Board Appeal** – appeal directly to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, where a Veterans Law Judge will review your case. You can choose a direct review (no hearing, no new evidence), submit additional evidence, or request a hearing. Board appeals take longer but allow legal arguments and judge review ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=%2A%20Ask%20for%20a%20higher,Level%20Review)).
  
  If you go through one lane and remain unsatisfied, you can then try another (for example, do an HLR, and if it’s still denied, file a Board appeal) ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=disagree%20with%20a%20VA%20benefit,can%20request%20a%20Clinical%20Appeal)). If after the Board decision you are still unsatisfied, the next step is to appeal to the **U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)** within 120 days of the Board decision (this is outside VA and involves a federal court review).

- **Reevaluations:** Sometimes VA will schedule a **future reexamination** for a condition expected to improve (noted in your decision letter). It’s important to attend the reexams – the VA can reduce ratings if evidence shows improvement. Conversely, if you think a condition has worsened and VA has not scheduled a reexam, proactively file for an increase rather than waiting.

**Tips for Increasing Your Rating:** Many veterans seek to increase their ratings over time, either by **adding new secondary conditions** or showing their existing conditions are worse. Some tips:
  - **Know the Rating Criteria:** VA ratings are based on specific criteria in the law. For example, PTSD 30% vs 50% hinges on certain symptoms and functional impairments. By reviewing the **VASRD criteria for your condition (38 CFR Part 4)**, you can understand what symptoms or limitations correspond to higher ratings.
  - **Medical Evidence:** To get a higher rating, you usually need medical evidence that your condition has worsened. This could be recent treatment records, test results, or a doctor’s opinion. **Private medical opinions or DBQs** (Disability Benefits Questionnaires) filled out by your doctor can sometimes support your case, especially if they detail how your condition meets the higher rating requirements.
  - **Consistent Treatment:** Stay on top of treatment for your conditions. Not only is this good for your health, but medical records from ongoing treatment create a paper trail showing the evolution of your disability. If you haven’t seen a doctor in 5 years and then file for an increase, VA has little recent evidence to review. 
  - **Secondary Service Connection:** Consider whether you have any **secondary conditions** caused or aggravated by an existing service-connected disability. (For example, a veteran with a service-connected knee injury develops back problems due to an altered gait, or pain from injuries causes depression.) Secondary conditions, once proven with medical nexus, are compensable and can increase your overall combined rating.
  - **Total Disability/Individual Unemployability (TDIU):** If you cannot maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected conditions, you can apply for TDIU. TDIU allows VA to pay you at the 100% rate even if your schedular rating is less than 100%. Typically you need at least one condition at 60% or a combined 70% with one at 40%, but there are exceptions.

**Other Disability Benefits:** In addition to monthly compensation, certain ratings confer extra benefits:
  - **Healthcare:** As mentioned earlier, **any** service-connected rating qualifies you for VA health care eligibility (and **free VA healthcare for those with 50%+ or for any condition that is SC**).
  - **Dental:** Veterans rated 100% or with certain dental injuries are eligible for VA dental care. Those with ratings 0-90% generally are not, unless the dental issue is service-connected.
  - **Commissary and Exchange:** Veterans with a VA disability rating (even 0%) are eligible for DoD-issued veteran ID cards (or can use their VA health ID) that grant **base access** to use military commissaries, exchanges, and morale/recreation facilities (this benefit was extended in 2020 to all service-connected veterans and Purple Heart recipients, whereas previously it was limited to 100% P&T) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=CHAMPVA%20is%20available%20to%20dependents,any%20of%20the%20following%20criteria)).
  - **Adaptive Equipment:** Veterans with certain disabilities can get grants for adaptive equipment, like **automobile adaptive equipment** for those with loss of limbs or impaired mobility, or **clothing allowance** for those whose prosthetics or appliances cause wear on clothing.
  - **Special Monthly Compensation (SMC):** If you have severe disabilities (like loss of use of limbs, blindness, need for aid and attendance, etc.), VA may pay additional compensation beyond the 100% rate. SMC rates are for specific situations (e.g., need of regular aid & attendance, loss of reproductive organ use, etc.).

## VA Appeals Process

If you disagree with a VA decision on your claim (whether it’s a denial of service connection or the percentage assigned, or an effective date), there is a structured **decision review and appeals process**. In 2019, VA implemented the **Appeals Modernization Act (AMA)** which replaced the old lengthy appeals system with more options and faster review lanes ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=VA%20decision%20reviews%20and%20appeals)).

**Decision Review Options (within VA):** Under AMA, when you receive a decision (called a Rating Decision or Statement of Case), you have **three main options** if you respond within one year of the decision date:

1. **Supplemental Claim:** You can file a Supplemental Claim if you have **new and relevant evidence** to provide that VA didn’t consider before ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=,we%20reviewed%20your%20case%20before)). The VA will review the new evidence and render a new decision. This is often used if, for example, you were denied and then obtained a new doctor’s opinion or new medical test results. Supplemental Claims are usually handled by the same office but a different reviewer.

2. **Higher-Level Review (HLR):** You can request a Higher-Level Review for the same evidence already in the file ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=%2A%20Ask%20for%20a%20higher,Level%20Review)). A more senior claims adjudicator will re-examine your case **de novo** (anew) without new evidence. This option is good if you suspect an error was made in the initial decision or that the decision didn’t properly weigh the evidence. During an HLR, you can request an optional **one-time informal phone conference** to point out specific errors to the reviewer. Keep in mind, since no new evidence is allowed, you should not choose HLR if you have additional documents to submit – in that case, do a Supplemental Claim.

3. **Board Appeal:** You can appeal directly to the **Board of Veterans’ Appeals**, where a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) will review your case ([VA Decision Reviews And Appeals | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/#:~:text=evidence%20with%20a%20Higher)). When filing a Board appeal (using VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), you must choose one of three dockets:
   - **Direct Review:** No hearing, no new evidence. The judge reviews the same record for clear errors. (This is the fastest Board option, around a year or so on average.)
   - **Evidence Submission:** No hearing, but you **may submit additional evidence** (within 90 days of filing the appeal).
   - **Hearing with a Judge:** You get a personal hearing (virtual or in DC) to speak to a VLJ and you may also submit additional evidence. This docket takes the longest (often several years wait) due to hearing scheduling and transcript preparation.
   
Under AMA, you can **pursue these options simultaneously for different issues** if you want (for example, you could file a Supplemental Claim for one condition and a Board Appeal for another). If you choose one route and are denied again, you can then choose another route as long as you are within the allowed time frames. For instance, a common path might be: get an initial denial -> file a Higher-Level Review (denied) -> gather new evidence -> file a Supplemental Claim (denied) -> then appeal to the Board.

**Key point:** You generally have **1 year from the date of a decision** to initiate one of these appeals (or 60 days if it was a Statement of the Case in the old system). If you miss that window, the decision becomes final. After that, you can only reopen via a Supplemental Claim with new and relevant evidence (your effective date for benefits may be reset in that case).

**Legacy Appeals:** Decisions dated before February 19, 2019, fell under the old legacy process (with Notices of Disagreement to the Regional Office, Statement of the Case, VA Form 9 substantive appeal to the Board, etc.). If you still have a **legacy appeal** in progress, you can opt into AMA by filing a Supplemental Claim or HLR, or continue with the legacy process. New appeals must use the AMA system.

**Appeal to the Court:** If the Board of Veterans’ Appeals denies your appeal (or grants less than the full benefit sought), you can appeal **outside VA** to the **U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)**. This must be done within **120 days** of the BVA decision. The CAVC is a federal court and you will typically need an attorney (many attorneys will represent veterans at the CAVC on contingency or even pro bono for strong cases). The Court can affirm, remand, or reverse BVA decisions. Beyond the CAVC, there is the Federal Circuit and even the Supreme Court for further appeals, but those are rare in practice.

**Getting Help:** VA’s decision review process can be complex. It’s often wise to get assistance from a **VSO, claims agent, or attorney** – many VSOs will help with appeals for free, and there are also law clinics and nonprofit groups that assist. **Accredited representatives** have access to your VA claim file and can help craft arguments or identify errors (like a missing medical opinion or misapplied regulation) ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=what%20to%20do%20after%20you,get%20your%20rating)). 

**Status Tracking:** You can track the status of your appeals on **VA.gov** or eBenefits. When you file a Supplemental or HLR, the VA.gov status should update to reflect it. For Board appeals, once docketed, you can even check the VA’s Board of Veterans’ Appeals docket listing (or the Appeals Status tool on VA.gov) to see your place in line.

**Appeals Reform Benefits:** The AMA system was designed to **reduce wait times**. Supplemental claims and HLRs are often completed in a few months. Board direct review appeals have been averaging about a year. This is a significant improvement from the legacy system, where appeals could take 5-7 years or more. Also, AMA allows **continuous pursuit** of claims – if you keep your appeal within one year timeframes, you preserve your original effective date even as you move between review options. For example, if you get denied in 2023, file an HLR in 2023 (denied in 2024), file a Board appeal in 2024, and win in 2025 – your effective date can still be from your original 2023 claim.

## Housing Benefits (Home Loans and Housing Grants)

### VA-Backed Home Loans

One of the most significant benefits for veterans and service members is the **VA Home Loan Guaranty Program**. This program helps veterans obtain mortgages to buy, build, or refinance a home, often with **more favorable terms** than conventional loans – including **zero down payment** (in most cases), **no private mortgage insurance (PMI)**, and competitive interest rates. The VA does **not** lend the money; instead, VA “backs” a portion of the loan, which encourages private lenders to offer better terms.

**Types of VA Home Loans:**
- **Purchase Loans:** For buying a home (can be an existing house, condo, new build, etc.). 
- **Cash-Out Refinance:** To refinance an existing mortgage (VA or non-VA) and extract equity (or to pay off other debt).
- **Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL)** or “Streamline Refinance”: a simplified refinance of an existing VA loan to get a lower rate or payment.
- **Native American Direct Loan (NADL):** A VA direct loan program for eligible Native American veterans to buy/build on federal trust land (limited audience).

**Eligibility for VA Home Loans:** To qualify for a VA-backed loan, you need a valid **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)** which VA issues based on your service record. Key service requirements include ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=Can%20I%20get%20a%20Certificate,backed%20home%20loan)) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,Gulf%20War%20period%20to%20present)):
- **Length of Service:** Veterans must have met **minimum active-duty service** thresholds:
  - For **wartime periods** (e.g., WWII, Korea, Vietnam): generally **90 days** of active duty ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,Vietnam%20War)) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,WWII)).
  - For **peacetime periods** (e.g., late 1975–1980): generally **181 days** continuous active duty ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,Vietnam%20War%20period)) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=You%20meet%20the%20minimum%20active,requirement%20if%20you%20served%20for)).
  - If you **entered service after Sept 7, 1980** (enlisted) or **Oct 16, 1981** (officer), the requirement is typically **24 months** continuous or the full period you were called to serve (at least 90 days) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,Gulf%20War%20period%20to%20present)), unless discharged early for an exception (hardship, disability in line of duty, etc.).
  - **Gulf War era to present (Aug 2, 1990 – present):** generally 24 months or the full call-up period (or 90 days if early discharge for hardship) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,Gulf%20War%20period%20to%20present)).
- **Reservists/National Guard:** Generally need to have **6 creditable years** in the Selected Reserve/Guard *and* either honorably discharged, retired, or continued service, **OR** have been activated for federal service for at least **90 days** (Title 10 orders) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=For%20National%20Guard%20members)) ([Eligibility For VA Home Loan Programs | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/#:~:text=,period)). (Since 2021, some changes allow those with lesser service but a deployment to qualify under certain conditions).
- **Discharge Status:** Must have a discharge that is **not dishonorable** (honorable, general, or other-than-honorable might still qualify). Dishonorable discharges are disqualifying for VA loans.

If you meet these criteria, VA will issue a COE. Many lenders can access the COE online for you instantly. Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected causes (and have not remarried, or remarried after age 57 under certain rules) **may also be eligible for VA home loan benefits** ([Home Loans For Surviving Spouses | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/housing-assistance/surviving-spouse-home-loan/#:~:text=,before%20December%2016%2C%202003%2C%20or)). For example, if a veteran died on active duty or due to a service-connected disability, the surviving spouse can often obtain a COE for a VA loan ([Home Loans For Surviving Spouses | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/housing-assistance/surviving-spouse-home-loan/#:~:text=,before%20December%2016%2C%202003%2C%20or)). (There are specific rules about remarriage: a spouse who remarried after age 57 (and after Dec 16, 2003) can retain eligibility ([Home Loans For Surviving Spouses | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/housing-assistance/surviving-spouse-home-loan/#:~:text=,before%20December%2016%2C%202003%2C%20or)).)

**Key Features and Advantages:**
- **No Down Payment:** You can finance 100% of the purchase price, as long as the sale price doesn’t exceed the appraised value. This makes homeownership accessible without needing tens of thousands for a down payment.
- **No PMI:** Unlike FHA or conventional loans with <20% down, VA loans **do not require private mortgage insurance**. This significantly lowers the monthly payment.
- **Competitive Interest Rates:** VA loans often have rates as good as or better than conventional loans, because the VA guaranty reduces risk for lenders.
- **Lenient Credit/DTI Requirements:** While lenders set their own credit score and debt-to-income ratio requirements, VA guidelines are somewhat more flexible. It’s possible to get a VA loan with a median FICO score in the low 600s (or sometimes lower) whereas conventional loans often require higher scores.
- **Limits on Closing Costs:** VA rules limit what closing costs veterans can be charged. Additionally, sellers can pay closing costs (and even points) up to 4% of the loan amount to reduce out-of-pocket expense for the buyer.
- **Funding Fee:** VA loans do come with a **one-time funding fee** (a percentage of the loan amount) that helps offset the cost to taxpayers. This fee can be **financed into the loan**. The funding fee varies: first-time use is 2.15% (if no down payment) for regular military, and 2.3% for loans after 2020; subsequent use is 3.6% if no down. However, **veterans receiving VA disability compensation (even 0% rating)**, Purple Heart recipients (on active duty), and some surviving spouses are **exempt** from the funding fee ([VA Housing Assistance | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/#:~:text=,may%20be%20right%20for%20you)) ([VA Housing Assistance | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/#:~:text=action%20or%20being%20held%20as,a%20prisoner%20of%20war)). If you have even a pending disability claim at time of closing that later gets approved, you may get the funding fee refunded.
- **Loan Limit:** As of 2020, VA removed county loan limits for those with full entitlement – meaning you can get any size loan (so long as you qualify with income/credit) with zero down. There are still *practical* limits based on what lenders will approve, but VA no longer caps the loan based on Freddie Mac conforming limits if you have no other active VA loans. If you have an existing VA loan and partial entitlement remaining, then loan limits could apply to additional loans.

**Using the Benefit:** To use a VA loan, follow these steps:
  1. **Obtain your COE:** Either through the eBenefits/VA portal or ask your lender to pull it. Surviving spouses need to fill VA Form 26-1817 and submit supporting documents (like marriage certificate, veteran’s death certificate, and in some cases proof the death was service-connected or the veteran was rated totally disabled) ([Home Loans For Surviving Spouses | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/housing-assistance/surviving-spouse-home-loan/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20apply%20for,a%20COE)).
  2. **Find a VA-approved Lender:** Most major banks, credit unions, and dedicated mortgage lenders offer VA loans. Shop around for the best rate/terms.
  3. **House Hunt and Sign a Purchase Agreement:** Make sure your real estate agent knows you’re using VA financing. VA loans require the property to meet certain **Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs)** (safe, sound, sanitary conditions).
  4. **Loan Process:** The lender will request an appraisal by a VA-certified appraiser to confirm value and that MPRs are met. They’ll also verify your income, credit, etc. Once satisfied, they close the loan.
  5. **Closing:** You’ll sign final documents. At closing you’ll need to pay any closing costs and funding fee (if not financed). Often, veterans negotiate for the seller to cover some costs.

You can use the VA loan benefit **multiple times** over your life (it’s not one-and-done). You can even have **more than one VA loan at a time** if you haven’t used all your entitlement (for example, you VA-financed a home, then get PCS orders and decide to rent that house out and buy another with VA – partial entitlement may be available for the second purchase, typically requiring a small down if any). When a VA loan is paid off or assumed by another veteran, that entitlement is restored.

**Native American Direct Loan (NADL):** A unique program where VA itself lends to Native American veterans for homes on federal trust land. It has similar benefits but relatively limited use.

**Grants for Service-Connected Disabilities (Housing Adaptations):** Beyond standard home loans, VA also helps severely disabled veterans with housing adaptations:
- **Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant:** For veterans with very severe service-connected disabilities (e.g., loss or loss of use of multiple limbs, total blindness, severe burns, ALS, etc.) ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=Qualifying%20service)). This grant helps build or modify a home for wheelchair accessibility and independent living. As of FY2024, the max SAH grant is **$117,024** ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=How%20much%20funding%20does%20an,SAH%20grant%20offer)). It can be used up to 6 times, in portions, up to the cap ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=Do%20I%20have%20to%20use,total%20grant%20amount%20this%20year)).
- **Special Home Adaptation (SHA) Grant:** For veterans with other specific disabilities (e.g., loss of use of both hands, certain severe burns or respiratory injuries) ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=Qualifying%20service)). Max SHA in FY2024 is **$23,443** ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=How%20much%20funding%20does%20an,SHA%20grant%20offer)). Also usable up to 6 times until cap reached.
- **Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) Grants:** If a SAH/SHA eligible veteran is living temporarily in a family member’s home, they can get a smaller grant to adapt that home (FY2024: up to $47,130 for SAH or $8,415 for SHA) ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=How%20much%20funding%20does%20a,TRA%20grant%20offer)) ([Disability Housing Grants For Veterans | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/#:~:text=If%20you%20qualify%20for%20an,grant%20program%20for%20FY%202024)).
- **Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) Grant:** Separate from SAH/SHA, HISA is a VA medical grant for any service-connected veteran (or for non-service-connected vets who are enrolled in VA health) to make **medically necessary home improvements**. It can be used in conjunction with SAH/SHA. HISA provides up to **$6,800** lifetime for service-connected veterans (or those with >=50% disabilities), and up to **$2,000** for other veterans enrolled in VA care ([Prosthetic & Sensory Aids Service (PSAS) - Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Services](https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/psas/hisa2.asp#:~:text=Lifetime%20benefit%20for%20Veterans%20and,Servicemembers)) ([Prosthetic & Sensory Aids Service (PSAS) - Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Services](https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/psas/hisa2.asp#:~:text=%242%2C000%20will%20be%20approved%20to%3A)). HISA can cover things like widening doorways, installing grab bars, walk-in showers, etc., based on a VA clinical assessment/prescription.

**Homelessness and Housing Assistance:** VA, in partnership with other agencies, runs programs to assist veterans who are **homeless or at risk of homelessness**:
- **HUD-VASH:** a joint HUD/VA program providing Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) paired with VA case management. Veterans get subsidized rent vouchers and support from VA social workers. HUD-VASH has helped tens of thousands of homeless vets find permanent housing.
- **SSVF (Supportive Services for Veteran Families):** grants to community nonprofits that provide eviction prevention, rapid rehousing funds, and case management to veteran families.
- **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans:** If you’re a homeless veteran or know one, call **877-4AID-VET (877-424-3838)** any time for help connecting to services ([VA Housing Assistance | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/#:~:text=Find%20the%20support%20you%20need%3A)). Every VA Medical Center has a Homeless Veteran Program Coordinator.
- **Emergency Housing:** VA and local organizations operate **transitional housing** (Grant & Per Diem program) and other shelters targeted to veterans.
  
Additionally, some states and cities have special veteran homelessness initiatives (like Veteran-specific shelters, tiny home villages, etc.), but those fall outside federal scope.

**Tips & Hidden Gems:**

- **Credit Not Perfect?** Don’t assume you can’t get a VA loan. Many veterans with middling credit scores have been able to secure VA financing because the program is more forgiving of past financial issues (so long as there’s been recovery). Shop around lenders, as some have more flexible credit overlays than others.
- **Funding Fee Waiver:** If you have a **pending VA disability claim** when you close on your loan, and it later gets approved, you can apply for a **refund of the funding fee**. Many veterans are unaware of this. If there’s a chance of a disability rating, it’s worth noting on your loan application that you expect to be exempt, so the lender can easily process a refund if/when your rating comes through.
- **Life Insurance:** When you buy a home (VA or not), consider your life insurance needs. VA offers low-cost **Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI)** to severely disabled veterans (SAH grant recipients) to pay off the home in event of their death. Others might consider using VA’s life insurance programs (like **VALife** for service-connected vets) or USAA, etc., to ensure their mortgage would be paid for their family if something happens.
- **Loan Assumption:** VA loans are **assumable** with VA approval. This means if you sell your home, a buyer (veteran or not) can potentially assume your loan at that same interest rate. In a rising rate environment, this is a huge selling point if your rate is low. If a non-veteran assumes it, your entitlement remains tied up until they pay it off; if a veteran assumes it, they can substitute their entitlement. 
- **Don’t Pay for COE or Info:** Obtaining your VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility is free – do it through eBenefits or a lender. Beware any website trying to charge a fee service to “help you get your VA loan” – plenty of official and nonprofit resources will guide you at no cost.

## Education Benefits (GI Bill & VR&E)

Education benefits for veterans (and often for their family members) are a cornerstone of the VA benefits package. The **GI Bill** has empowered generations of veterans to attend college or vocational training, and other programs like **Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E)** support veterans with service-connected disabilities in achieving education and career goals. Below are the major education-related programs:

### Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)

The **Post-9/11 GI Bill** is the most widely used educational benefit today. If you served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you likely earned entitlement under this program. It provides funding for **tuition, fees, a monthly housing allowance, and money for books** for a variety of educational and training programs.

**Eligibility:** Generally, at least **90 days of aggregate active duty service** after 9/10/2001 (or 30 days if discharged due to a service-connected disability) is required. The benefit tier depends on the length of service:
- 36 months or more (including basic training time) = 100% benefit.
- 30 months = 90%.
- 24 months = 80%.
- 18 months = 70%.
- 6 months = 60%.
- 90 days = 50%.  
*(Note: If you only did initial entry training and no longer active duty, you might not qualify for Post-9/11 but could have Montgomery GI Bill – see below.)*

Service members can also qualify after **a single 90-day period of active duty** if, for example, they were mobilized guard/reserve.

**What it Covers:** At the 100% tier, the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay:
- **Tuition & Fees:** Up to the full cost of in-state tuition and fees at public institutions. For private or foreign schools, there’s an annual cap (around $27,120 for the 2024-2025 year). These payments go directly to the school ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=,the%20maximum%20stipend%C2%A0per%20school%20year)). If you’re attending a private school that charges above the cap or an out-of-state public tuition, you may utilize the **Yellow Ribbon Program** (more below) to cover extra costs.
- **Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA):** This is a stipend for living expenses. If you’re going to school **more than half-time**, you receive an MHA based on an **E-5 with dependents** rate for the ZIP code of your school (averaging $1,700–$2,500+ in many areas) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=Find%20out%20if%20you%20can,to%20school%20or%20have%20no)). If you’re taking all courses **online (remote)**, the housing allowance is a national average (~$950/month in recent years). MHA is paid to you monthly. (Active duty members or their spouses using transferred benefits do *not* get MHA while the service member is on active duty.)
- **Book Stipend:** Up to $1,000 per academic year for books and supplies (paid proportionally at $41 per credit hour, up to 24 credits in a year) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=monthly%20housing%20allowance%20on%20the,to%20school%20or%20have%20no)). This is paid to you at the start of each term (usually $500 per semester if full-time).
- **Relocation/Travel Assistance:** A one-time $500 relocation allowance for eligible students coming from certain rural areas to attend school (specific criteria apply, like if you lived in a county with few people and have to travel far or fly to school) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=,to%20get%20to%20your%20school)).

**Duration:** The benefit provides up to **36 months** of education entitlement (a traditional 4-year degree typically uses 36 months across 8 semesters). If you have used part of a different GI Bill (e.g., Montgomery GI Bill) you cannot exceed 48 months combined usage across multiple programs.

**Expiration (Delimiting Date):** Under the **Forever GI Bill** (Harry W. Colmery Act of 2017), if your last discharge from active duty was on or after **January 1, 2013**, your Post-9/11 GI Bill **never expires** – you can use it at any point in your life ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=If%20your%20service%20ended%20before,or%20you%E2%80%99ll%20lose%20whatever%E2%80%99s%20left)). If you left service before that date, you have 15 years from separation to use it ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=This%20depends%20on%20when%20you,were%20discharged%20from%20active%20duty)). (Those whose GI Bills expired under the old rules cannot get back unused entitlement, unfortunately, unless Congress changes the law again.)

**Yellow Ribbon Program:** If you’re at the 100% benefit level, the **Yellow Ribbon** program can help cover tuition that exceeds the standard cap. Many private universities participate in Yellow Ribbon – they agree to waive a certain portion of tuition, and VA matches that waiver. For example, a private university might waive $10,000 of tuition and VA pays another $10,000 – so $20k extra covered on top of the GI Bill’s base cap ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=You%20may%20qualify%20for%20these,additional%20benefits)). This can potentially allow **free or very low-cost attendance at expensive schools** (Ivy League, etc.) for veterans at 100% tier. Note: Active duty servicemembers are not eligible for Yellow Ribbon (but their spouses using transferred benefits are now eligible as of 2020). To use Yellow Ribbon, you must apply with your school – each school has limited slots or specific colleges/majors they cover.

**Transferring Benefits:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill allows servicemembers to **transfer unused benefits to a spouse or children**, but there are strict rules. Transfer must be done while on active duty (or in the Selected Reserve) – you generally need **at least 6 years of service and commit to 4 more years** (some exceptions around force shaping or pending retirement). If approved by DoD ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=,qualify%20for%20the%20Marine%20Gunnery)), you can allocate months of your 36-month entitlement to your spouse and/or kids. Once transferred, the family member can use it just like the veteran would (with some differences: a spouse can use it immediately if the member has 6+ years; a child can only use after the member has 10 years service, and the child must use it by age 26). The housing stipend is not payable to the spouse if the service member is still on active duty (since you have housing provided), but if the spouse uses it after the member leaves service or if a child uses it, the stipend is paid. **Transferred benefits remain subject to the same expiration** – but if the servicemember’s benefit is the Forever GI Bill (no expiration), transferred benefits likewise don’t expire. Keep in mind, **the transferability is a DoD retention benefit**, not a right – if you separated without transferring, you cannot do it afterwards. Also, if you transferred and then left service earlier than your commitment, the transfer can be revoked by DOD.

**Application:** To use the GI Bill, you must submit VA Form 22-1990 (or 22-1990e for dependents using a transferred benefit) – this can be done on **VA.gov’s education benefits application** ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20get%20these,benefits)). VA will issue a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) that you take to your school certifying official. Most schools have a **Veterans Certifying Official** in the registrar or financial aid office who will then certify your enrollment to VA each semester so payments can be issued. VA also provides tools like the **GI Bill Comparison Tool** to research school costs and outcomes.

**Fry Scholarship:** This is effectively the Post-9/11 GI Bill for **survivors**. If you are the child or surviving spouse of a servicemember who died in the line of duty after 9/10/2001, you may be eligible for the Fry Scholarship, which gives you the full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (36 months at 100% level) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=,qualify%20for%20the%20Marine%20Gunnery)). Children can use it up to age 33. Surviving spouses have no time limit if they remain unmarried (if they remarry, eligibility ends). Surviving spouses can also elect DEA (see below) instead in some cases – there’s a choice to be made because you cannot use both Fry and DEA concurrently.

**Other GI Bill Programs:** 
- **Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30):** This was the primary program before 2009. Some pre-9/11 veterans still have it. It required $1,200 pay reduction and provides a fixed monthly payment (around $2,150/month in 2024) to the student (as opposed to tuition coverage + MHA structure). MGIB benefits expire 10 years after service. Many MGIB users have since switched to Post-9/11. If you have both, you can actually use MGIB for 36 months and then get 12 extra months of Post-9/11 (thanks to a court ruling in 2022 (Rudisill case) allowing up to 48 months total if you earned two GI Bills) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=You%20may%20qualify%20for%20a,AD%20benefits)) ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=,AD%20benefits)).
- **Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR, Chapter 1606):** For Guard/Reserve members who commit to six years. It pays a smaller monthly stipend (~$439/month for full-time in 2024) while in drilling status. It cannot be used after leaving the Selected Reserve (except in certain disaster mobilization cases).
- **Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC):** A pilot program that started in 2019 providing funding for veterans to attend short-term coding bootcamps or IT training outside the normal school structure. It’s separate from the GI Bill (doesn’t use your entitlement). It became very popular and was expanded/extended by Congress. VET TEC pays the training provider and also gives the veteran a housing stipend (same as GI Bill’s MHA). Limited to those with at least one day of GI Bill entitlement remaining.
- **STEM Scholarship:** An extension for Post-9/11 GI Bill users in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Math) fields who exhaust their 36 months but need more time to complete a program (like a 5-year engineering degree). It can give up to 9 extra months or $30,000 of benefits.

**VR&E (Chapter 31) – Veteran Readiness & Employment:** (Formerly called Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment). This program is separate from the GI Bill, though often used for education. It is available to veterans with **service-connected disabilities** that cause an employment handicap. See below for details on VR&E.

**Tips & Notes:**
- **Monthly Verification:** Post-9/11 GI Bill users are now required to verify enrollment monthly (via text or email or the VA EDU hotline) to continue receiving the MHA ([Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#:~:text=Note%3A%20If%20you%20use%20Post,housing%20allowance%20or%20kicker%20payments)). It’s a quick “yes I’m still enrolled” check.
- **Failing Classes/Grades:** GI Bill will pay for classes you pass. If you fail a class, it still counts as used entitlement but you don’t have to repay (assuming you attended the whole term). If you **drop or withdraw** after the drop period, VA may create an overpayment for tuition/MHA for that period unless it was due to mitigating circumstances. Always consult your school VA official before schedule changes.
- **Using GI Bill with Federal Financial Aid:** GI Bill doesn’t count as income for FAFSA purposes (so it won’t reduce federal grants). You can receive Pell Grants and GI Bill simultaneously if eligible due to income – essentially “free money” on top. Many states also have veteran or dependent tuition waivers that can complement GI Bill.
- **Housing Stipend Timing:** It’s paid at end of month for that month. So if your term starts in August, you’ll get your first housing payment in September (pro-rated for August days in class). Budget accordingly.
- **Apprenticeships/OJT:** GI Bill isn’t just for college – it can be used for apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and certain flight and correspondence courses. During apprenticeships/OJT, GI Bill pays a monthly stipend that decreases each six-month period as your wages (presumably) increase, over 2 years.
- **Licensing/Certifications:** You can use GI Bill to pay for licensing and certification exam fees (like bar exams, IT certifications, Project Management Professional exam, etc.), up to $2,000 per test (this does deduct entitlement proportional to $2k = one month).
- **College Credit for Military Training:** Be sure to have your Joint Services Transcript (JST) or CCAF transcript sent to your school. Many schools will grant some academic credit for certain military courses or MOS-related experience, which can shorten your program and save entitlement.

### Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E) – Chapter 31

**What VR&E Is:** VR&E is a program to help veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, find, and maintain suitable careers or achieve independence in daily living. It’s often thought of as “Voc Rehab.” It can pay for **education and training programs (even beyond what GI Bill covers)**, as well as provide career counseling, resume assistance, and more. In some cases, VR&E will pay for advanced degrees (Masters, etc.) if necessary for your vocational goal, which the GI Bill alone might not cover if you ran out of entitlement.

**Eligibility:** To qualify, you must have a **service-connected disability rating of at least 10%** (with a VA memo rating or official rating) and **other-than-dishonorable discharge** ([Eligibility For Veteran Readiness And Employment | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/eligibility/#:~:text=All%20of%20these%20must%20be,true)). Practically, 10% with an employment handicap or 20%+ with an employment handicap qualifies for services. “Employment handicap” generally means the disability creates a barrier to suitable employment. If you have a 0% or are awaiting a decision, you wouldn’t qualify until you get at least 10%. Note: Active duty service members expecting a discharge can also apply if they have a “memo rating” of 20%+ or are in the IDES process.

There used to be a **12-year basic period of eligibility** from date of discharge or first VA rating, but that time limit is waived if you have a serious employment handicap, and importantly, for any veteran discharged after 2013, the 12-year time limit no longer applies ([Eligibility For Veteran Readiness And Employment | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20were%20discharged%20from,these%20dates%2C%20whichever%20comes%20later)) ([Eligibility For Veteran Readiness And Employment | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/eligibility/#:~:text=If%20you%20were%20discharged%20from,time%20limit%20on%20your%20eligibility)) – VR&E has no expiration for them.

**Entitlement & Services:** When you apply to VR&E, you will meet with a **Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)** who will evaluate whether you have an employment handicap and are entitled to services. If found entitled, you and the counselor will develop a **plan** with one of five tracks:
  - **Reemployment:** help you return to your previous job (particularly if you were medically separated and want to work with your former employer with accommodations).
  - **Rapid Access to Employment:** if you already have the skills and just need help finding a job (job placement, resume, interview coaching, etc.).
  - **Self-Employment:** if you have the aptitude and interest to start a business, VR&E can provide training and even materials to support a small business launch for certain disabled vets (usually those with significant barriers to traditional employment).
  - **Employment Through Long-Term Services (Education/Training):** this is the most common – it can pay for college, trade school, certification, apprenticeship, etc., including graduate degrees if necessary.
  - **Independent Living:** for veterans who can’t currently work due to the extent of disabilities – provides services to improve independence in daily life (equipment, housing adaptations, life skills training, etc.).

If the plan involves **education or training**, VR&E may cover full tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, etc., often more comprehensively than the GI Bill would. Veterans in training under VR&E also receive a **monthly subsistence allowance**. They have the choice to either use the Post-9/11 GI Bill housing stipend rate (often higher) or the Chapter 31 subsistence rate (which as of 2024 is around $700-$1000 a month depending on number of dependents and training time, unless using the GI Bill rate). Using VR&E for education does *not* decrement your GI Bill entitlement in most cases (unless you elect the GI Bill rate, in which case it will use GI Bill months concurrently, but VR&E could extend beyond 36 months if needed). Many veterans with a 100% GI Bill use VR&E after GI Bill is exhausted to fund graduate school.

**Duration:** Typically, a VR&E education plan can authorize up to **48 months of benefits** (which may be separate from the GI Bill’s 36 months). In some cases, they can extend if needed for the program. There is often an emphasis on **employment outcomes** – the goal is to lead to a good job. That means VR&E won’t pay for “professional student syndrome” or endless degree changes; they want a focused goal. 

**What VR&E Can Pay For:** Not just tuition – they can cover things like **professional licenses or certifications**, tools required for a trade, specialized software or equipment (e.g., a high-power laptop for an IT student, or even a vehicle hand-control modification if needed to drive to training). They can also pay for **adaptive equipment** for training if needed (like special furniture for someone with orthopedic injuries). If relocation is needed for a job, sometimes VR&E can assist with moving expenses. VR&E counselors can also arrange **work accommodations** and coordinate with employers (e.g., ergonomic chairs, modified workstations, telework options).

**Applying:** Apply through VA’s **eBenefits or VA.gov** (Veteran Readiness & Employment section) ([How To Apply For Veteran Readiness And Employment - VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/how-to-apply/#:~:text=How%20To%20Apply%20For%20Veteran,session%20at%20your%20nearest)). VA Form 28-1900 is the application. After applying, expect a letter scheduling you for an orientation and initial meeting with a counselor at your regional office. There is also a program called **“VR&E Rapid Access to Employment – Skillbridge”** that can allow some active duty folks to use VR&E just before separation in lieu of DoD Skillbridge.

**Hidden Tips:**
- If you have a **service-connected disability that makes college difficult** (for example, a TBI affecting memory, PTSD affecting concentration, etc.), know that campuses often have **disability support services**. Also, VR&E can sometimes fund **tutoring** or other accommodations to help you succeed in school.
- Veterans using VR&E can often also use **VetSuccess on Campus** services – VA has counselors at many colleges to assist veterans in navigating benefits and support.
- If you start with Post-9/11 GI Bill for school and then your VA ratings increase (e.g., you get 20%+), you can switch to VR&E if you qualify – it might extend your funding if you need more schooling. Always consider VR&E if you have a service-connected disability and your GI Bill isn’t sufficient for your goals.
- VR&E can be used for non-college goals too: e.g., flight training for a commercial pilot’s license (if that’s your employment goal and justified by your background), or coding bootcamps, or apprenticeships.
- **Self-Employment Track:** Rare but if you qualify (usually severe disability precluding normal employment), VR&E might provide things like a computer, printer, maybe initial inventory or licenses for a small business. They require a solid business plan.

## Employment and Job Placement Resources

Transitioning from the military to civilian employment can be challenging. Fortunately, there are numerous **resources to help veterans (and their spouses) find jobs, obtain training, and secure fulfilling careers**. These resources span federal and state government programs, as well as nonprofits and private sector initiatives.

### Federal Employment and Hiring Preferences

Many veterans pursue careers in the federal government. There are specific advantages for veteran applicants:
- **Veterans’ Preference:** Eligible veterans (generally those with an honorable discharge and in some cases a service-connected disability) receive **either a 5-point or 10-point hiring preference** when applying for federal jobs ([Federal jobs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-federal-jobs#:~:text=As%20a%20veteran%2C%20you%20may,not%20every%20veteran%20is%20eligible)). In practice, this means if a position is hiring competitively, qualified veterans are ranked higher on the certificate of eligible candidates. **5-point preference** is for non-disabled veterans who served during certain wartime periods or in receipt of certain medals. **10-point preference** is for veterans with service-connected disabilities or Purple Heart recipients (and certain spouses, widows, or mothers of disabled/deceased vets). *Note:* Veterans’ preference doesn’t guarantee a job – you must meet qualification requirements and be among the best candidates – but it is a significant boost ([Federal jobs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-federal-jobs#:~:text=As%20a%20veteran%2C%20you%20may,not%20every%20veteran%20is%20eligible)).
- **Special Hiring Authorities:** The federal government has special non-competitive hiring paths for veterans:
  - **Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA):** Allows hiring of eligible veterans up to GS-11 without competition. Eligibility: disabled vets, or vets with active service in a war or campaign badge, or recently separated (within 3 years) – with at least an other-than-dishonorable discharge. If hired, the vet enters excepted service and after 2 years can be converted to competitive service.
  - **30% or More Disabled Veteran:** Any veteran with a 30%+ VA disability can be hired non-competitively to any position for which they’re qualified (temporary or term appointment that can convert to permanent).
  - **VEOA (Veterans Employment Opportunity Act):** Gives preference eligible and certain veteran (3+ years service) access to apply to jobs that are otherwise only open to “status” candidates (like current federal employees). It’s a way to allow vets to compete for merit-promotion openings.
  - **Schedule A for People with Disabilities:** Not a veteran-specific authority, but vets with disabilities can also use this excepted service hiring path for those with severe disabilities (with a doctor’s certification). 
- **USAJOBS.gov:** This is the main portal for federal jobs ([Federal jobs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-federal-jobs#:~:text=Find%20government%20jobs%20for%20veterans,and%20apply)). When building your USAJOBS profile, be sure to claim your preference eligibility and upload your DD214 and VA disability letter if applicable ([Federal jobs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-federal-jobs#:~:text=USAJobs,applying%20for%20federal%20government%20jobs)). You can filter searches to show jobs open to Veterans or those with VRA/Schedule A.
- **Feds Hire Vets:** The federal government’s veteran employment website (fedshirevets.gov) provides a lot of info on these programs, as well as a list of **Veteran Employment Program Offices (VEPO)** in each agency – these are agency-specific veteran recruiters who can assist veterans navigating the hiring process ([Federal jobs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-federal-jobs#:~:text=Contact%20veteran%20employment%20program%20offices,by%20government%20agency)).
- **Military Skills Translator:** USAJOBS has tools to help translate your military occupation to federal jobs series to search.

Also, note that **military service counts towards federal civil service retirement** (if you later “buy” your military time back into the civilian retirement system), and there are provisions if you’re a reservist such that federal employers must permit leave for military duties.

### Career Counseling and Transition Assistance

- **DoD Transition Assistance Program (TAP):** This is the mandatory pre-separation counseling offered by DoD, which includes workshops on job search, resume writing, translating military experience, and VA benefits briefings. Be sure to attend TAP and take advantage of classes like Boots to Business (for entrepreneurship) or specialized tracks if available.
- **VA Career Counseling (Chapter 36):** VA offers **Personalized Career Planning and Guidance (PCPG)**, often referred to as Chapter 36 benefits. It’s **free career counseling** for transitioning service members and veterans (up to one year after discharge) as well as those currently using VA education benefits ([Job programs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-job-programs#:~:text=Get%20career%20counseling)). You can get help with figuring out what career path or education path suits you, how to maximize your GI Bill, etc. You apply through eBenefits (it’s an often under-used benefit).
- **Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E):** (Discussed earlier) – even if you’re not using it for education, note that VR&E can provide **job placement services**. They have **Employment Coordinators** who develop relationships with employers and can assist with résumé referrals and interview leads for VR&E clients ([Job programs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-job-programs#:~:text=Veterans%20with%20disabilities)).
- **CareerOneStop – Veterans Job Matcher:** The U.S. Department of Labor’s CareerOneStop site has a **Veteran and Military Transition Center** ([Job programs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-job-programs#:~:text=Prepare%20for%20a%20civilian%20job)). It includes a Military-to-Civilian **Occupation Translator** and tools to match your military skills to civilian jobs ([Job programs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-job-programs#:~:text=Visit%20CareerOneStop%E2%80%99s%20Veteran%20and%20Military,plan%20your%20next%20career%20and)). It also provides access to state job banks, apprenticeship finder, and labor market information.
- **American Job Centers (AJC):** There are 2,500+ AJCs nationwide (also known as One-Stop Career Centers). Many have a **Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program (DVOP) specialist** or **Local Veterans’ Employment Representative (LVER)** on staff funded by DOL VETS. They provide intensive employment assistance to veterans, especially those with barriers (like disabilities, homelessness). **Priority of service**: By law, veterans (and eligible spouses) go to the front of the line for any AJC services and training programs.
- **Department of Labor VETS:** DOL’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Service oversees programs like Jobs for Veterans State Grants (funds those DVOPs and LVERs) and **Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP)** which funds organizations that help homeless vets get job training and employment.

### Private Sector and Nonprofit Employment Programs

- **Hiring Fairs and Initiatives:** Many organizations run veteran-specific career fairs, sometimes in partnership with VA or state agencies. **Hiring Our Heroes** (run by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation) is a major initiative that hosts hiring events across the country and also runs a corporate fellowship program placing transitioning service members into 12-week internships at companies.
- **Corporate Veteran Recruiting:** Almost every large company has a veterans recruiting program or at least recruiters focusing on vets. Some companies even have **military skillbridge** internships (for active duty in last 6 months) and then direct hire. **Use LinkedIn** to find veteran recruiters or employees in companies you like – vets often refer and help each other out.
- **LinkedIn Premium**: Speaking of LinkedIn – **LinkedIn offers veterans a free one-year Premium Career subscription** (which includes LinkedIn Learning access) ([Veteran subscriptions - the LinkedIn Social Impact](https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/programs/veterans/premiumform#:~:text=Impact%20socialimpact,year%20Job%20Seeker%20Career%20Premium)), and as of 2023 this also extends to military spouses and certain caregivers ([Military and veterans I Global Impact - the LinkedIn Social Impact](https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/programs/veterans#:~:text=Military%20and%20veterans%20I%20Global,military%20community)). This is extremely valuable – Premium lets you message recruiters, see who viewed your profile, and do lots of courses. To get it, you verify through ID.me or TroopID on LinkedIn’s veterans page. After the free year, if you still have your GI Bill, there’s a separate program where VA can reimburse licensing/test fees which some have used for things like the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam, etc.
- **Veteran Mentorship Programs:** Consider joining a mentorship program:
  - **American Corporate Partners (ACP):** offers free year-long mentorships, pairing you 1-on-1 with a mentor in the career field you’re interested in (often mid/senior career professionals at major companies). This can be great for networking and guidance.
  - **Veterati:** a platform where you can schedule free mentoring phone calls with volunteer mentors across various industries for an hour at a time.
  - **Service Academy Career Conferences** (for academy grads) and others exist specifically to connect vets to employers.
- **SkillBridge (DoD Program):** If you’re still in service and within 6 months of separation, **SkillBridge** can allow you to do an internship or training at a civilian employer while still on active duty (your command must approve). There are hundreds of SkillBridge partners including big corporations and trade schools. This often leads to a job at the end. While not a VA benefit, it’s a crucial opportunity for those about to transition.
- **State-Level Programs:** Many states have veteran employment initiatives – such as “Veterans Preference” for state jobs, free training programs, etc. (Check your state’s Department of Labor or Veterans Affairs office for details, though state benefits are outside our scope here.)

### Entrepreneurship

If you aim to start a **business**, there are resources for veteran entrepreneurs:
- **Small Business Administration (SBA) – Boots to Business:** If you’re transitioning, the TAP program’s Boots to Business class gives an intro to entrepreneurship ([Job programs for veterans | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/veteran-job-programs#:~:text=Start%20a%20veteran)). SBA also has a course series called B2B Reboot for veterans.
- **SBA Office of Veterans Business Development:** They fund **Veteran Business Outreach Centers (VBOC)** around the country which provide training, workshops, counseling, and referrals (like to SBA loan programs).
- **SBA Loans:** While there’s no exclusive veteran SBA loan, some programs waive fees for veteran-owned small businesses on certain loans. Check SBA’s “Express Loan” for veterans.
- **Veteran Entrepreneurship Training:** Several universities run intensive programs (often free for vets) like **IVMF at Syracuse University (“Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans”)**, **Bunker Labs** (has community and programs for veteran startups), and the **Veterans Future Lab** in NYC. 
- **Mentoring:** SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives) has volunteer mentors, and many are specifically experienced in helping veterans launch businesses.
- **Government Contracting:** If your business is at least 51% owned by a veteran (or better, a service-disabled veteran), you can get a certification as a **Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)** or Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) through SBA’s certification process. Government agencies have contracting goals to award a percentage of dollars to SDVOSBs, which can give you an edge in federal procurement.

### Notable Nonprofits and Free Resources

- **Hire Heroes USA:** A nonprofit that offers free, one-on-one job search coaching and resume writing for veterans and spouses. They have a proven track record and will assign you a transition specialist who works with you over time.
- **Veterans ASCEND (now called **Akera**):** Uses skills-matching to connect veterans to employers by translating your skills to job requirements (some Reddit users have recommended it).
- **Onward to Opportunity (O2O):** Syracuse University’s IVMF runs this program that offers **free online training and professional certifications** in fields like project management, Six Sigma, HR, IT (several certs like CISSP, AWS, etc.) to transitioning service members and veterans/spouses.
- **Coding Bootcamps:** Several coding bootcamps offer **scholarships or free seats for veterans** (e.g., Code Platoon in Chicago is a coding bootcamp specifically for vets/spouses and aligns with GI Bill; Galvanize, General Assembly, etc. often have discounts). Also, the VET TEC program discussed earlier is a gem for IT training.
- **Apprenticeships:** Veterans can use GI Bill in apprenticeships (get a stipend). Also, some unions and industries have veteran initiatives (Helmets to Hardhats for construction trades, Troops Into Transportation for trucking, etc.). The Department of Labor has a new initiative to expand apprenticeships for veterans.
- **Military Spouse Employment:** There are separate programs for spouses (e.g., DoD’s **Military Spouse Career Advancement Accounts (MyCAA)** for certain training if the servicemember is junior, and **Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP)** which many companies have joined to commit to hiring spouses). The USO, Hiring Our Heroes, and others run programs specifically for spouse professional development. Spouses can also access things like LinkedIn Premium for free for one year ([Active-duty, guard, and reservists | Global Impact](https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/programs/veterans/activeduty#:~:text=Impact%20socialimpact,to%20support%20your%20professional%20journey)).

**Hidden Tip:** Networking is key. Tap into **veteran alumni networks** (your college may have a veterans club; many companies have internal Vet Employee Resource Groups). Don’t shy from using the **Veteran tag on LinkedIn** – it often attracts recruiters or fellow vets willing to help. 

And importantly, **utilize your local resources**: if you’re near a military base, they may have frequent employer days. If you’re in a city, see if there’s a Veterans Chamber of Commerce or meetups for veterans in your industry.

## Mental Health Support and Treatment

Mental health is a critical aspect of veterans’ overall well-being, and both the VA and many external organizations provide robust support. **Veterans face unique challenges** – from PTSD, depression, anxiety, or MST (Military Sexual Trauma) to the difficulties of transition and sometimes suicidal crises. The good news: **help is available, and it’s okay to ask for it.**

### VA Mental Health Services

If you are enrolled in VA health care (see Health Care section), **mental health care is part of your medical benefits**. This includes:
- **Outpatient therapy and counseling:** one-on-one counseling (talk therapy) with psychologists or social workers, as well as **group therapy** sessions (for example, combat veteran groups, MST survivor groups, anger management groups, etc.).
- **Psychiatric services:** evaluation and treatment by psychiatrists who can prescribe medications for conditions like PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.
- **Inpatient psychiatric care:** if needed, the VA has mental health inpatient units for acute crises (like severe suicidal ideation or psychosis). They also have **Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (RRTPs)** which are longer-term live-in programs focusing on specific issues (PTSD programs, substance abuse (SUD) domiciliary programs, homeless rehab programs, etc.).
- **Emergency care:** Every VA medical center has an emergency department or urgent care where mental health crises can be addressed. Additionally, under a new policy (the COMPACT Act 2023), **any veteran in acute suicidal crisis can seek emergency care at any VA or even non-VA hospital and VA will cover the costs** – up to 30 days inpatient or 90 days outpatient – **even if the veteran is not currently enrolled in VA health care** ([Starting Jan. 17, Veterans in suicidal crisis can go to any VA or non-VA health care facility for free emergency health care - VA News](https://news.va.gov/press-room/starting-jan-17-veterans-in-suicidal-crisis-can-go-to-any-va-or-non-va-health-care-facility-for-free-emergency-health-care/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Starting%20Jan,system%20to%20use%20this%20benefit)). This is a significant expansion aimed at preventing suicide by removing barriers to care. If you or a vet you know is in a serious crisis, go to the nearest ER and know that VA can take care of the bill.
- **Tele-mental health:** VA has greatly expanded telehealth. You may be able to do counseling sessions or med management over secure video from home (VA can issue you an iPad for telehealth if you lack technology). There are also smartphone apps (like **PTSD Coach**, **Mindfulness Coach**, etc.) and an online self-help portal **MakeTheConnection.net** that shares veteran stories of coping.
- **Vet Centers:** These are community-based counseling centers separate from hospitals. **Vet Centers provide free counseling to combat veterans, veterans who experienced MST, and their family members, *regardless* of enrollment or discharge status** ([VA Mental Health Services | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/#:~:text=Eligible%20service%20members%2C%20Veterans%2C%20and,compensation%20to%20use%20these%20services)). Services include individual, group, marriage/family counseling, bereavement counseling for families of KIAs, and more. They are staffed often by veterans (many are combat vets themselves) and offer a more informal environment. Vet Centers do not share records with the VA medical system unless you authorize it, which some vets prefer. They have a 24/7 Vet Center Call Line **1-877-WAR-VETS (927-8387)** for after-hours.
- **Medication:** VA can and will prescribe psychiatric medications when appropriate. Veterans can get these meds either from VA pharmacies or by mail (and often with no copay if the condition is service-connected or if you have low income or certain priority).
- **Specialty clinics:** Many VAs have specific clinics for PTSD, often offering evidence-based therapies like **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)** or **Prolonged Exposure (PE)**. They also have programs for conditions like chronic pain management (which often ties in mental health for coping strategies), and **Military Sexual Trauma (MST) coordinators** to help connect survivors to care.

To access care, you usually start by telling your **primary care provider** you’d like mental health services, or you can contact the mental health clinic at the VA directly for an appointment ([VA Mental Health Services | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20schedule%20my,first%20appointment)). If you’re new to VA, during the initial screening they usually ask if you have any mental health needs.

Importantly, **VA cannot share your mental health treatment information without your consent**, except in very limited circumstances (like danger to self/others). Seeking help will **not** jeopardize your VA rating (unless perhaps you claim you’re totally fine mentally to get a job but trying to get 100% for PTSD – generally clinical care is separate from the benefits evaluation process). It also does **not impact your security clearance** in most cases (seeking treatment is seen positively; what hurts clearance is leaving it untreated and having it affect duty).

### Veterans Crisis Line

For immediate help 24/7, the **Veterans Crisis Line** is available to all veterans, service members (even active duty), and their family/friends. **Dial 988 then Press 1** (in the U.S.) to be connected to trained counselors ([Veterans Crisis Line](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/#:~:text=24%2F7%2C%20confidential%20crisis%20support%20for,chat%20online%2C%20or%20text%20838255)). You can also **text 838255** or chat online at veteranscrisisline.net. This is free and confidential. Many responders are veterans themselves. They will listen and can help de-escalate a crisis, and connect you with local resources (they can even dispatch emergency services if needed). You do not have to be enrolled in VA to use this – it’s open to all.

*(Side note: Active duty can also call 988 Press 1 – it’s now agreed that active duty members will be helped and it won’t automatically go to command or anything. So anyone can use it.)*

If you’re experiencing a mental health emergency (e.g., feeling like you might harm yourself or someone else), **please reach out** – call 988, or go to the nearest ER. Under the new policy mentioned, **VA will cover emergency suicide care for all veterans** at any facility ([Starting Jan. 17, Veterans in suicidal crisis can go to any VA or non-VA health care facility for free emergency health care - VA News](https://news.va.gov/press-room/starting-jan-17-veterans-in-suicidal-crisis-can-go-to-any-va-or-non-va-health-care-facility-for-free-emergency-health-care/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Starting%20Jan,system%20to%20use%20this%20benefit)).

### Community and Non-VA Mental Health Resources

Beyond the VA, numerous organizations support veterans:
- **Give an Hour:** A nonprofit that enlists volunteer mental health professionals to provide **free counseling** to veterans and families (generally one hour a week, for as long as it takes). They started by focusing on post-9/11 vets but may have expanded.
- **The Cohen Veterans Network:** This network has established **Cohen Clinics** in many cities – they offer **low or no-cost mental health services to post-9/11 veterans and their families** (and they’ll see other-era vets too in many cases). They provide therapy for individuals, couples, children (for family of vets), and are very accessible (some same-week appointments).
- **Wounded Warrior Project (WWP):** They have a **Project Odyssey** (an outdoor retreat-based mental health program), and WWP can also connect alumni with private therapists through their **Warrior Care Network** partners (four academic medical center programs for intensive PTSD treatment, such as the **Road Home Program at Rush University**, **Home Base Program in Boston**, **UCLA/Emory programs**). These are specialized intensive outpatient programs (2-3 week PTSD programs) for post-9/11 veterans that are **cost-free** (WWP covers travel, etc.). 
- **Headstrong Project:** Provides **confidential, cost-free mental health care** for post-9/11 veterans by partnering with clinicians across the country, using evidence-based treatments. You can self-refer on their website.
- **PsychArmor** and **Objective Zero:** These are not direct treatment, but helpful resources – PsychArmor educates community caregivers on veteran issues; Objective Zero is a peer support app that can connect you (via text or voice) to veteran peer volunteers if you just need to talk to someone who gets it.
- **Local Groups:** Many areas have veterans groups that meet for peer support (Vet Centers often run combat support groups, etc.). Organizations like **Team Red, White & Blue** and **Team Rubicon** focus on connecting vets in physical and community service activities which can indirectly support mental health through camaraderie and sense of purpose.

**Substance Abuse Treatment:** VA provides SUD (Substance Use Disorder) treatment – both outpatient groups and inpatient rehab programs. There are also support groups like AA/NA available at many VA facilities. If you’re struggling with alcohol or drugs, VA can help detox and provide rehab, often integrated with mental health care (since co-occurring PTSD and substance use is common).

**Military Sexual Trauma (MST):** Veterans (male or female) who experienced sexual assault or harassment in service can get **free MST-related counseling and care at VA**, even if not otherwise eligible for VA health care. VA has MST coordinators and every VA medical center must provide care for physical and mental health conditions related to MST **at no charge**. You just need to say you’re seeking MST services.

**Family Support:** VA can provide **marital and family counseling**, especially through Vet Centers or certain VA clinics (family therapy for issues like PTSD’s impact on the family). Also, **Tricare** (for those still eligible) and **CHAMPVA** (for spouses of 100% disabled) cover mental health treatment for dependents. There are also nonprofits focusing on families (Sesame Street for Military Families has resources for kids; programs like **FOCUS** help military kids with stress).

**Suicide Prevention Initiatives:** VA has specific programs like the **Veterans Crisis Line** (mentioned), **Suicide Prevention Coordinators** at each VA facility, and new programs that provide **outreach to recent high-risk vets**. Under the recent Commander John Scott Hannon Act, grants are being given to local orgs to do community outreach for suicide prevention. So you might see local veteran coalitions forming.

**Hidden Tips:**
- Many veterans find that connecting with peers improves mental wellness – consider joining a group like Team RWB (they do physical fitness meetups, run clubs, etc.), Team Rubicon (disaster response—teamwork and service can be therapeutic), or a local vet org doing outdoor activities (like **Sierra Club Military Outdoors** has free outdoor expeditions).
- If you’re in college, check if your campus has a **student veterans organization** – having that camaraderie on campus can ease stress. Also, many schools have counseling centers; as a veteran student you can use both the campus center and the VA concurrently if you wish.
- For those who prefer anonymity or are not ready for formal therapy, consider **online communities**. The Reddit community r/Veterans or r/MilitarySupport often have people discussing mental health coping. Just hearing others’ experiences can help you feel less alone. (But always verify info – personal anecdotes aren’t professional advice.)
- **Service dogs:** Some veterans with PTSD or MST find comfort and improved functioning with a service dog or emotional support animal. VA will cover veterinary insurance for service dogs for certain conditions (primarily hearing, vision, mobility impairment, and recently some psychiatric service dogs in a pilot program). There are nonprofits that train and pair service dogs with veterans (though be cautious, there are waiting lists and some cost issues).
- **Alternative therapies:** VA increasingly offers or partners to provide alternatives like **mindfulness meditation classes, yoga for vets, art therapy, equine therapy** (some VA medical centers have those or refer to community programs). These can be great adjuncts to traditional care.

**Key Resources:**
- **Veterans Crisis Line:** Dial **988 then Press 1** (24/7) ([Veterans Crisis Line](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/#:~:text=24%2F7%2C%20confidential%20crisis%20support%20for,chat%20online%2C%20or%20text%20838255)); or Text 838255; or Chat [VeteransCrisisLine.net] – for any crisis, big or small.
- **VA Mental Health Services:** [VA Mental Health] – overview of services and how to access ([VA Mental Health Services | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20schedule%20my,first%20appointment)) ([VA Mental Health Services | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/#:~:text=Eligible%20service%20members%2C%20Veterans%2C%20and,compensation%20to%20use%20these%20services)).
- **Vet Center Locator:** [Vet Center Directory] – find your nearest Vet Center for counseling (they have 300+ locations).
- **Make the Connection:** [MakeTheConnection.net] – website with vets’ stories by topic (e.g., “dealing with anger,” “post-traumatic stress”) and links to resources.
- **Find Local Support:** [PsychArmor “Help”] or simply calling 211 can connect you to community mental health resources if not using VA.
- **Headstrong Project:** [getheadstrong.org] – free therapy for post-9/11 vets in many states.
- **Cohen Veterans Network:** [Cohen Veterans Clinics] – check if there’s a clinic near you.

Above all, please remember: **You are not alone, and reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.** Whether it’s through VA or a buddy or a hotline, there are people who care and want to help veterans get through the tough times. As the saying goes, “It’s okay not to be okay – but don’t stay that way, reach out.”

## Survivor and Dependent Benefits

The sacrifices of military service also extend to families. The U.S. government and VA provide several benefits to **surviving spouses, children, and other dependents** of veterans, especially when the veteran is severely disabled or has passed away. These benefits can include **financial compensation, education assistance, health care, and more** for eligible family members.

### Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)

**DIC** is a tax-free monetary benefit paid to **eligible survivors of:
1) Service members who died in the line of duty**, OR 
2) **Veterans whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease**, OR 
3) **Veterans who were rated totally disabled from service-connected conditions for a certain period before death, even if the death was not due to those conditions** ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=,a%20certain%20period%20of%20time)) ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=,died%20after%20September%2030%2C%201999)).

In essence, if the VA effectively recognizes that the veteran’s service caused their death (either directly or by a presumptive rule), DIC is provided to the surviving spouse, children, and sometimes dependent parents.

**Who Can Get DIC (Spouses):** A surviving spouse is eligible for DIC if:
- The veteran died on active duty, OR died from service-connected disabilities, OR **was continuously rated 100% service-connected disabled for at least 10 years prior to death** (or 5 years from discharge, or 1 year if a former POW who died after Sep 30, 1999) ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=If%20the%20Veteran%E2%80%99s%20eligibility%20was,must%20have%20had%20this%20rating)). (These last conditions are often called the “10-year rule” etc. – they allow DIC even if the cause of death wasn’t service-connected, recognizing the veteran’s long period of total disability).
- The spouse was **married to the veteran at time of death**, and one of these is true: married to the veteran for at least 1 year, or within 15 years of the service period in which the cause of death started, or had a child with the veteran ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=,the%20Veteran%20or%20service%20member)). (If a spouse married the vet after service and the death was due to service, the marriage length requirement is one year minimum.)
- If the spouse **remarries**, DIC typically stops, unless the remarriage happened after age 57 (or after age 55 for remarriages after 2021 change) ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=Note%3A%20If%20you%20remarried%2C%20you,one%20of%20these%20describes%20you)). Recent law (2018) lowered that remarriage age to 57 to keep DIC (prior was 57, now consistent at 57 unless law changed to 55 effective 2021 as indicated).
- There are also provisions for **surviving children** (under 18, or 18-23 if in college, and not married) to receive DIC if there is no surviving spouse, or sometimes in addition to spouse (the rates differ in those cases) ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=All%20of%20these%20must%20be,true)) ([About VA DIC For Spouses, Dependents, And Parents | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/#:~:text=,a%20certain%20period%20of%20time)). And **surviving parents** can receive an income-based version of DIC called “Parents’ DIC” if their income is very low and the veteran died from service causes.

**DIC Payment Amount:** It is a flat monthly rate for the spouse (not dependent on the veteran’s rank or disability rating). As of 2024, DIC for a surviving spouse is around $1,562 per month. There are add-ons: e.g., if the veteran was totally disabled for 8 years prior to death and the spouse was married those 8 years, there’s an added allowance (the “8-year provision”); if the spouse is entitled to Aid & Attendance or is housebound themselves, there are small add-ons; if they have minor children, there’s an add-on per child. Each dependent child (if no spouse) gets a certain amount (about $600 a month each, with a kicker if more than two children). The exact rates update annually with COLA.

**How to Apply for DIC:** Use VA Form 21-534EZ (Application for DIC, Survivor’s Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits) via VA.gov or mail. Provide the veteran’s death certificate (showing cause of death), and marriage certificate, and children’s birth certs if applicable. If the death was clearly service-connected (like KIA or due to a condition already service-connected), it’s straightforward. If claiming the death was service-related and the veteran wasn’t already SC for that condition, you’ll need to provide medical evidence of the connection (or show it was on the list of presumptives, etc.). VA often automatically sends info to spouses of veterans who were rated totally disabled when they die, to invite them to apply for DIC.

**Special Cases:**
- **Concurrent Receipt Issue:** Surviving spouses cannot receive both DIC and a military Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity without offset – however, recent law changes (the “Widows Tax” elimination) are phasing out that offset by 2023. By 2023, surviving spouses of retirees can get full SBP and full DIC concurrently (previously DIC reduced SBP dollar-for-dollar, but now they will get both, with SBP offset elimination completed).
- **If Veteran Dies While Claim or Appeal Pending:** There’s something called **“accrued benefits”** – if the veteran had a claim pending that is later granted after death, certain benefits can accrue to the survivor. Also, the **substitution rule** allows a spouse to step into the shoes of the veteran to continue a pending claim or appeal, potentially leading to a **posthumous award** which could result in retroactive compensation payout to the survivors.
- **Survivors of Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans:** Just a note – if a Vietnam vet’s death was from Agent Orange presumptive condition, even if not claimed in life, the spouse can claim DIC. The Blue Water Navy law in 2019 extended those presumptions to sailors off Vietnam’s coast.

### Survivors Pension (Death Pension)

This is a needs-based (income and asset limited) benefit for low-income surviving spouses and unmarried children of deceased **wartime veterans**. Often just called “Survivors Pension.”
- The veteran must have had at least 90 days of active military service, with at least one day during a wartime period (if entered active duty after 1980, generally must have 24 months or the full period, similar to the requirement for Veterans Pension).
- The veteran must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.
- The **surviving spouse must meet income and net worth limits** ([Survivors Pension | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/survivors-pension/#:~:text=A%20VA%20Survivors%20Pension%20offers,meet%20certain%20income%20and)). Essentially, all countable income (including Social Security, etc.) minus certain deductions (like for medical expenses) is considered. If that income is below the annual pension limit (which for a single surviving spouse might be around $10,000-14,000 per year, dependent on rates), then VA will pay the difference as a monthly benefit. If income is zero, they get the full pension amount; if income is, say, $5k below the limit, they get $5k/12 per month.
- Surviving spouse must not be remarried (if they remarried and are still with new spouse, they’re not eligible).
- **Net worth limit:** As of 2024, net worth (which includes assets + annual income) must be below around $150,000 (the threshold VA uses for pension programs). The primary residence and personal vehicle are not counted as assets.

The Survivors Pension amounts are modest (and reduced by other income dollar for dollar, which is why many survivors do not receive much or anything if they have Social Security or other benefits). For example, a single surviving spouse (no aid and attendance) might have a limit around $10,000. If their income is $8,000 from Social Security, VA pension would only be $2,000/yr (paid monthly). If they have high unreimbursed medical expenses, those can be deducted from income to help qualify.

- **Aid & Attendance for Surviving Spouse:** If the surviving spouse is severely disabled or in need of aid and attendance (or housebound), there are higher income limits and pension rates (just like with Veterans Pension +A&A). This is sometimes used by elderly widows to help pay for assisted living or caregivers. For instance, a widow in need of A&A might get a few hundred dollars more per month.

Applying for Survivors Pension uses the same VA Form 21-534EZ. Must report all income, assets.

Survivors Pension is sometimes known colloquially as the “VA Widow’s pension.”

### Survivors’ & Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA, Chapter 35)

**DEA (Chapter 35)** provides education and training benefits to eligible **dependents of certain veterans**. Typically, this means:
- The child or spouse of a veteran who **died in the line of duty**, OR
- The child or spouse of a veteran who **died from service-connected disabilities**, OR
- The child or spouse of a veteran who **is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected conditions**, OR was *not* P&T but died while having any VA permanent total rating.
- It can also apply to spouses of service members missing in action or POW for 90+ days.

In other words, **if a veteran has a 100% permanent service-connected rating, or died of service-connected causes, their dependents are likely eligible for DEA benefits** ([Chapter 35 - Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA)](https://veteranservices.ucmerced.edu/dependents/chapter-35#:~:text=The%20Survivors%20and%20Dependents%20Educational,dependents%20and%20spouses%20of%20veterans)).

**What DEA Provides:** A monthly education benefit paid **directly to the dependent student** (not to school). The student can use it for degree programs, certificate courses, apprenticeship/OJT, even correspondence courses. The **monthly payment** as of late 2024 is around $1,450 per month for full-time training (it adjusts annually). If training part-time, it prorates (e.g., ~$726 for half-time). This money is typically used for tuition, fees, books, etc., but there’s no restriction – it’s a stipend.

**Duration:** A dependent child can use up to **36 months** of DEA. A spouse can use 36 months as well. A child’s eligibility window is generally between ages **18 and 26** (there are some exceptions if they haven’t finished high school by 18, or if the veteran’s eligibility is decided later, etc.) ([Using Survivor and Dependent Benefits (Ch. 35)](https://military.gwu.edu/using-survivor-and-dependent-benefits-ch-35#:~:text=Using%20Survivor%20and%20Dependent%20Benefits,a%20monthly%20educational%20assistance)). A spouse’s eligibility period is usually 10 years from either the date the veteran was rated P&T, or the date of death (it extends to 20 years if the vet was P&T and then died of any cause). Surviving spouses of those who died on active duty have 20 years.

**Using DEA:** The process is similar to GI Bill – you apply via VA Form 22-5490 (for dependents), and once VA issues a Certificate of Eligibility, the student coordinates with the school VA certifying official. DEA cannot be used at the same time as Fry Scholarship (which is the Post-9/11 GI Bill for survivors). A surviving spouse or child of an active-duty death has the choice: **Fry Scholarship vs DEA**. Fry (Post-9/11 GI Bill) tends to be much more generous if they want to attend college (it pays full tuition + housing + books). DEA is sometimes chosen by those who might not be full-time students (since DEA you could potentially do part-time or use after GI Bill, etc., or for some types of training not covered by Fry, but Fry covers most). Also a spouse can use Fry for 36 months and then also use DEA for up to 48 combined if they wanted (recent law now allows using both Fry and DEA as long as not at same time, up to 48 months total).

One scenario DEA is useful: If a veteran is 100% P&T and not using their GI Bill benefits (maybe they already did or never had Post-9/11), their dependents can use DEA *and* the veteran can transfer Post-9/11 to them (if still eligible), so that could stack (but a child cannot use both concurrently – they’d have to use one then the other up to 48 months total). A spouse could use DEA after GI Bill or vice versa up to 48 months too.

### CHAMPVA (Healthcare for Dependents)

**CHAMPVA** (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA) is a health insurance program for certain dependents:
- It covers **spouses and children of veterans who have a 100% permanent and total service-connected disability** ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=CHAMPVA%20is%20available%20to%20dependents,any%20of%20the%20following%20criteria)).
- It also covers **surviving spouses/children of veterans who died from a service-connected condition**, or who at death were rated 100% P&T (even if death wasn’t service-connected) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,are%20not%20eligible%20for%20TRICARE)).
- If the spouse or child is **eligible for TRICARE** (e.g., the veteran was a retired military who died, in which case spouse/kids usually get TRICARE as a military retiree benefit), then CHAMPVA is not applicable – CHAMPVA is generally for dependents who are *not* otherwise eligible for DoD TRICARE. For example, if a 100% disabled veteran is not medically retired from military, their family gets CHAMPVA since they have no TRICARE.
- **Important**: When a 100% P&T veteran turns 65 and goes on Medicare, their spouse’s CHAMPVA continues but they usually must enroll in Medicare as well (CHAMPVA becomes secondary to Medicare for the spouse at 65). Actually, CHAMPVA requires those eligible for Medicare to have Medicare Part A & B, then CHAMPVA acts as supplementary insurance.

CHAMPVA functions similarly to an insurance plan: it typically pays **75% of allowable amounts** after deductibles/copays (and if you have other insurance, it usually pays second). There is an annual deductible of $50 individual/$100 family and an out-of-pocket cap (catastrophic cap) of $3,000 per year ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,longer%20living%20with%20the%20veteran)). Many providers accept CHAMPVA, though it’s lesser-known than TRICARE. 

CHAMPVA covers most medically necessary services, including prescriptions (through Meds by Mail or a network pharmacy), mental health, etc. Spouses remain eligible unless they divorce or remarry (if a CHAMPVA-eligible surviving spouse remarries before age 55, they lose CHAMPVA; if after 55, they can keep it). Children are covered until age 18 (or 23 if full-time student) similar to other benefits ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,longer%20living%20with%20the%20veteran)).

**How to apply for CHAMPVA:** You submit VA Form 10-10d with supporting documentation (like rating decision of vet, marriage certificate, etc.) to the CHAMPVA center in Denver, CO. It takes about 6-8 weeks to get approval and an insurance card.

If you are a spouse on CHAMPVA, you also may purchase the **VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP)** at a discounted rate for dental coverage ([Getting Care Through CHAMPVA | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-care-through-champva/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20enrolled%20in%20CHAMPVA%2C,insurance%20at%20a%20reduced%20cost)), since CHAMPVA (like TRICARE) does not cover most dental.

### Commissary, Exchange, and Other DoD Benefits for Dependents of 100% Disabled

As mentioned earlier, **dependents of veterans who are 100% permanently & totally disabled** are eligible for certain DoD privileges:
- They can get a **DoD ID Card** (DD Form 1173) as dependents of a disabled veteran rated “Honorary Retiree” essentially. This ID grants them access to **military Commissaries, Exchanges (AAFES/NEX/MCX stores), and Morale, Welfare & Recreation (MWR) facilities** (like on-base gyms, libraries, parks, hotels such as Shades of Green at Disney, etc.) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,are%20not%20eligible%20for%20TRICARE)). The veteran also gets a different ID (DD Form 2765) that says “100% Disabled Veteran” which allows those privileges for themselves. 
- Surviving spouses and children of those who died on active duty or died of service-connected causes also are typically issued DoD ID cards (Survivor ID) that allow those base privileges (and TRICARE medical through DOD for active duty deaths).
- **Space-Available Travel:** Dependents of 100% disabled veterans recently got access to **Space-A flights** when accompanying the veteran (Category VI travel on military aircraft, for flights within CONUS and to U.S. territories) ([AMC Space Available Travel Page - Air Mobility Command - AF.mil](https://www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Space-Available-Travel-Page/#:~:text=AF,traveling)) ([AMC Space Available Travel Page - Air Mobility Command - AF.mil](https://www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Space-Available-Travel-Page/#:~:text=%28100,traveling)). (Space-A for 100% disabled veterans and their dependents was authorized by law in 2019 – veteran must have the DoD ID card (Tan card) and dependents can travel with the veteran on available flights) ([AMC Space Available Travel Page - Air Mobility Command - AF.mil](https://www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Space-Available-Travel-Page/#:~:text=AF,traveling)) ([Disabled Veterans can fly Space Available Flights for free - VA News](https://news.va.gov/60642/eligibility-disabled-veterans-space-available-flights/#:~:text=When%20congress%20signed%20the%20John,Aviation%20Units%20have%20flights%20available)).
- **State Benefits:** Many states offer free or discounted hunting/fishing licenses, state park access, property tax exemptions, etc., to 100% disabled vets and often extended to surviving spouses. (Not federal, but survivors should check state laws as they often inherit some of the veteran’s state perks in terms of property tax or education).

### Life Insurance Benefits

Veterans and their families have access to certain VA life insurance programs:
- **Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI):** A program that allows a servicemember to convert their SGLI after service to renewable term life insurance. The veteran can keep their coverage (up to what they had in SGLI, typically $400k max) for life as long as premiums are paid, regardless of health (if converted within 240 days of discharge no health questions, after that need health questionnaire). This is not free and premiums can become high as one ages, but it ensures insurability.
- **Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance (S-DVI):** This program provided up to $10k coverage for veterans with service-connected disabilities, and an extra $30k if totally disabled. However, S-DVI is closing to new enrollment as of end of 2022, replaced by **VALife**.
- **VALife (Veterans Affairs Life Insurance):** Starting Jan 2023, VALife offers up to $40,000 guaranteed whole life insurance for service-connected veterans (0-100% ratings) with no medical underwriting and lifetime coverage. Good for those with serious disabilities who can’t get commercial insurance. Premiums are based on age at sign-up and fixed.
- **Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (addressed earlier)** is in effect like an insurance/indemnity for the spouse.
- **Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) & Family SGLI (FSGLI):** For active duty and some reservists, but if a member dies on active duty, their SGLI (and any FSGLI) is paid out to the beneficiaries (often the spouse). The current SGLI is $500k as of 2023 increase. Also, **TSGLI** (Traumatic SGLI) provides lump sums for certain serious injuries (this is for the member, not survivors, but worth noting).
- **Burial life insurance?** Actually no, but if a retiree opted for **Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)**, that’s a DOD annuity for spouse/children (not VA but important for survivors to understand how it interacts with DIC as discussed). 

### Other Dependent/Survivor Benefits:

- **Educational & Career Counseling:** Surviving spouses and dependents also can use Chapter 36 career counseling through VA, similar to veterans, especially if they are using DEA or Fry benefits.
- **State War Orphans Education:** Many states waive tuition for children of fallen service members or 100% disabled veterans at state colleges.
- **Scholarships:** Numerous private scholarships exist for children of veterans or of fallen heroes (e.g., Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation, Folded Flag Foundation, etc.). Also Fry Scholarship (Post-9/11 GI Bill) covers a lot as mentioned.
- **Gold Star Family Resources:** The term “Gold Star” typically means family of someone who died in service. Gold Star families get some special recognition and programs. For example, Gold Star Family members (and now all Vietnam vet families etc. as well) can get the free lifetime National Park pass (see Free Services section).
- **Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Defense (CHAMPUS/TRICARE):** If the veteran was a military retiree, their spouse and children probably have TRICARE already for health. If they die, surviving spouses and kids remain eligible for **TRICARE Survivor benefits** (3 years at active duty rate if died on AD, then at retiree rates; if retiree dies, spouse gets TRICARE as a survivor indefinitely unless remarriage).
- **Dependent ID Cards:** Even while veteran is alive, if the veteran is 100% P&T, their family gets DoD ID cards as noted. If veteran dies of service cause, family gets DOD ID as Gold Star survivors (for base privileges, etc.). A unique benefit: Surviving spouses and dependents of those who died on active duty can also receive **education through Fry Scholarship or DEA** and often **housing on base for a year** after death or use of commissaries, etc.

**How to Access/Apply:** 
- **DIC / Survivors Pension / DEA / CHAMPVA** – The VA Form 21-534EZ as mentioned is a catch-all for DIC, pension, and accrued benefits. For DEA, use 22-5490. For CHAMPVA, use 10-10d. 
- Often a Casualty Assistance Officer will help newly bereaved families of servicemembers with initial paperwork (for DIC, SBP, etc.). For veterans who die post-service, it’s on the survivor to apply to VA for DIC.
- For dependents of living 100% disabled: the veteran should ensure the VA has recognized their dependents (submit VA Form 21-686c to add dependents to the award – this gives the veteran the additional compensation for spouse/children and also sets up those dependents in VA’s system which is useful for eligibility verification for things like CHAMPVA or education benefits).
- Many VSOs will help survivors file for these benefits as well. Organizations like **Gold Star Wives of America**, **Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS)**, etc., can provide support and guidance.

## Burial and Memorial Benefits

The VA’s National Cemetery Administration (and the DoD in some cases) ensures that veterans can be honored in death. Several benefits help ease the burden of funeral costs and memorialize the service of veterans:

### Burial in a VA National Cemetery

**Eligibility:** Most veterans are eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery **at no cost** to the family, provided they received a discharge other than dishonorable ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=The%20federal%20government%20will%20help,not%20have%20been%20dishonorably%20discharged)) ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=a%20veteran%20is%20entitled%20to,burial%20in%20a%20VA%20cemetery)). Service members who die on active duty are obviously eligible. Also eligible are:
- Veterans who meet minimum active duty service (usually at least 1 enlistment or as specified for period).
- Spouses and minor children of eligible veterans can be buried in the national cemetery as well, typically in the same grave plot as the veteran (stacked) or in nearby plots for cremains ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=a%20veteran%20is%20entitled%20to,burial%20in%20a%20VA%20cemetery)).
- Certain reservists/National Guard with 20 years creditable towards retirement (even if not activated) are eligible for burial in a national cemetery (and for a headstone/marker).

**What VA Provides:** If buried in a national cemetery, the VA covers:
- A gravesite (or columbarium niche for cremated remains, or space in a mausoleum if available, or scatter garden, etc. – depends on the cemetery).
- **Opening and closing of the grave**.
- **Perpetual care** of the gravesite.
- A **government headstone or marker** (granite or marble) or niche marker, with inscription (name, dates, and an optional emblem of belief and a brief inscription/term of endearment).
- A **burial flag** (the U.S. flag) to drape the casket or accompany the urn, given to next of kin after the service.
- **Military funeral honors**: By law, every eligible veteran has the right to at least a **two-person uniformed honor guard** to fold and present the flag and play “Taps” (live bugler or recorded) ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20circumstances%2C%20a%20veteran,%E2%80%9CTaps%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20a%20gun%20salute)). Usually local veterans organizations or active duty base honor guards will perform a fuller honors ceremony (rifle volley, etc.) if available. The funeral director or cemetery rep can arrange this with DoD.
- A **Presidential Memorial Certificate** (an engraved certificate signed by the President to honor the veteran’s service).
- If requested, a **VA medallion** can be provided to affix to a private headstone if buried in private cemetery (for veterans who prefer a custom headstone but still want recognition of military service).
- **Note:** Burials in Arlington National Cemetery have more restrictive eligibility (must be active duty deaths, retirees, highly decorated, etc.) ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=Arlington%20National%20Cemetery)). Arlington is run by the Army, not VA. Many notable national cemeteries (like those at Gettysburg, etc.) are VA-run. 

There are currently 155 national cemeteries (VA) across the U.S. – not every state has one, but VA is continually opening new ones or satellite columbaria to expand coverage. In addition, many states have **State Veterans Cemeteries** which often offer similar benefits (sometimes with a small fee for opening/closing for spouses, etc., depending on state).

If you desire burial in a national cemetery, you can plan ahead:
- VA offers a **Pre-Need Burial Eligibility Determination** process ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=Applying%20for%20a%20pre,determination)). You can apply while alive to get a decision letter confirming your eligibility for burial, to ease things for your family later. This does not reserve a plot at a specific cemetery, but it gives peace of mind about eligibility.
- When death occurs, the family (usually through the funeral director) contacts the National Cemetery Scheduling Office to arrange interment. They will need discharge papers to confirm eligibility (the pre-need letter simplifies that).

### Burial Allowances (Funeral and Interment Costs Reimbursement)

The VA can pay a **burial and funeral allowance** to help defray costs for a veteran’s funeral and burial, if the veteran was eligible. The amount depends on whether the veteran’s death was service-connected or not:
- If the veteran died **of a service-connected condition** (or while on active duty), VA will pay up to **$2,000** toward burial/funeral expenses (and if buried in a private cemetery, some or all of the transportation cost to that cemetery) ([Burial and Memorial Benefits For Soldiers - MyArmyBenefits](https://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Benefit-Library/Federal-Benefits/Burial-and-Memorial-Benefits-?serv=128#:~:text=MyArmyBenefits%20myarmybenefits,be%20eligible%20for%20a)).
- If the veteran’s death was **not service-related**, VA provides a smaller reimbursement: usually a **$300 burial allowance** plus (if not buried in a national cemetery) a **$828 plot or interment allowance** (these amounts are adjusted periodically for inflation) ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=If%20the%20veteran%20meets%20those,800%20for%20a%20burial%20plot)). As of FY2023, the plot allowance is $893. So commonly cited: $300 for funeral + around $800-900 for burial plot = total up to ~$1,100 for non-service-connected death ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=If%20the%20veteran%20meets%20those,800%20for%20a%20burial%20plot)).
- If the veteran was at time of death *entitled* to VA pension or compensation (or would be except for receiving military retired pay), or died in a VA facility (or VA-contracted nursing home), then the non-service-connected burial allowances are payable ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=Also%2C%20at%20least%20one%20of,full%20military%20or%20disability%20pay)). If none of those, VA might not pay a non-S/C burial benefit.

To get this allowance, a family member (or person who paid for the funeral) files VA Form 21P-530 (within 2 years of the burial). You submit receipts of expenses. VA will reimburse up to the allowed amounts if the costs were incurred. They pay to whoever actually paid the expenses (so if the funeral home wasn’t paid yet, they might not reimburse until someone pays it).

**Plot Allowance for certain vet graves:** If a veteran is buried in a **state veterans cemetery or private cemetery**, that $828 (or current rate) plot allowance can be paid to whoever bore the cost of the plot (often the family if a private cemetery, or the state if a state vets cemetery, which is why some state vets cemeteries are free – they take the VA plot allowance as reimbursement).

If the veteran is buried in a **national cemetery**, you don’t get a plot allowance because the grave is provided free. If the veteran was cremated and inurned in a national cemetery, again no plot allowance needed.

VA does not pay burial benefits if the death occurred during active service (because DoD provides death gratuity and handles interment) ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=If%20the%20death%20occurred%20while,or%20was%20a%20federal%20prisoner)). Also if a vet is buried at government expense (like died in a VA hospital with no next of kin and the VA arranged burial), the allowances don’t go to family.

### Headstones, Markers, and Medallions

VA will furnish a **headstone or marker for the grave of any deceased eligible veteran** at no cost, anywhere in the world, **even if buried in a private cemetery** ([Eligibility for a Headstone or Marker](https://cem.va.gov/cem/hmm/eligibility.asp#:~:text=Eligibility%20for%20a%20Headstone%20or,1%2C%201990)). This is true regardless of date of death for unmarked graves. For marked graves (e.g., maybe a family already had a tombstone but wants to add a military marker), VA can provide a smaller marker or medallion.
- **Headstone/Marker:** Typically upright white marble or granite, or flat bronze or granite markers. In national cemeteries, they conform to that cemetery’s style (mostly upright). In private cemeteries, the family must get the cemetery’s approval for style.
- **Inscriptions:** Include name, rank, branch, dates of birth/death, and an **emblem of belief** (religious symbol) if desired, and optionally a short inscription like “Beloved Father” or a military service war/years etc.
- **Medallion:** If the grave already has a commercial headstone, VA offers a medallion (small bronze affixable badge) that signifies the person was a veteran, with “US Veteran” and the branch of service. These come in different sizes.

These must be applied for (VA Form 40-1330). Usually the next of kin or cemetery can do it. For vets that died on or after 1990, VA can provide a headstone/marker even if the grave is already marked by a private headstone (so families can have both).

Spouses and dependent children buried in a national cemetery get a similar headstone with their info on the back of the veteran’s headstone or the same side below the veteran’s info (they share a headstone). However, VA does not provide free headstones for spouses buried in private cemeteries – only veterans.

### Military Funeral Honors and Flags

As mentioned, by law, **at least two members of the Armed Forces (at least one from the same branch the veteran served) will, upon request, perform the ceremony of folding and presenting the U.S. flag and sounding “Taps”** at the funeral of an eligible veteran ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20circumstances%2C%20a%20veteran,%E2%80%9CTaps%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20a%20gun%20salute)). Usually the funeral director coordinates this with a local active-duty base or a reserve unit or VFW/American Legion honor guard.

- **Burial Flag:** VA provides one free **U.S. flag** per veteran to drape the casket or accompany the urn. After the service, it is typically given to the next of kin as a keepsake. You request the flag using VA Form 27-2008 and typically pick it up from a VA regional office or post office. Funeral homes often handle this. (Note: If there’s no next of kin, a friend can receive the flag. Only one flag is given.)

### Presidential Memorial Certificate (PMC)

This is an embossed certificate with the veteran’s name, signed by the current President, honoring the veteran’s service. Families can request multiple copies to give to relatives. The funeral director or anyone can request these via VA’s application form or online.

### Reimbursement of Transportation of Remains

If a veteran died due to service-connected causes, VA will pay for transportation of remains to the burial site (within certain limits). Also if the veteran died in a VA facility or en route to one, VA may cover transport to the place of burial. This is part of the burial allowance or separate if service-connected death.

### Other Memorial Benefits:

- **Arlington National Cemetery:** If a veteran or service member is eligible (criteria includes KIA, certain high awards, retirees, etc.), Arlington offers some unique options like interment in that prestigious cemetery or inurnment in the columbarium. This is highly sought and limited. The Arlington website details those strict rules ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=Arlington%20National%20Cemetery)) ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=,30%2C%201993)).
- **State Veteran Cemeteries:** Many states have cemeteries – eligibility is usually similar to national, often including veterans who were residents of that state. Some states charge a small fee for spouse burial, others free for both vet and spouse. Check each state’s rules.
- **Additional Honors:** Families can request a copy of the veteran’s service records or awards from the National Archives to display at the funeral. Also, some families choose to have organizations like the **Patriot Guard Riders** attend if they fear any protests (they started to shield families from Westboro-type protests, but nowadays they often attend as a sign of respect anyway).
- **Private Memorials:** If a veteran is memorialized in a place but not buried (e.g., lost at sea, or buried at sea, or ashes scattered), VA can provide a memorial headstone to be placed in a cemetery (*Memorial* markers).
- **Benefits for Families of KIA:** Outside VA, note that if a service member dies on active duty, their family gets a $100,000 death gratuity, SBP, and other DoD survivor benefits. Not VA’s purview, but important context for survivors of active duty. VA then kicks in with DIC and education, etc., if applicable.

**How to Access:**
- **Burial in National Cemetery:** Usually arranged at time of need by calling the National Cemetery Scheduling Office or by using the Pre-Need program ([Veteran Burial Benefits Explained: What You Need to Know](https://www.dav.org/get-help-now/veteran-topics-resources/memorial-death-benefits/#:~:text=Applying%20for%20a%20pre,determination)).
- **Burial Benefits Claim (allowances):** Submit VA form 21P-530 with supporting docs (death certificate, receipts, DD214).
- **Headstone/Marker:** Submit VA form 40-1330 to NCA or use their online ordering system.
- **Burial Flag:** Provided through funeral director or VA regional office/post office with form 27-2008.
- **PMC:** Request via VA Form 40-0247 or email/online on VA’s PMC page.

**Tips:**
- Many veterans groups (VFW, American Legion) provide burial rituals or at least volunteer honor guards. If the veteran was a member, the family can reach out to the post.
- There is no VA monetary benefit specifically for a spouse’s funeral (only the veteran themselves). But if a spouse passes and is to be buried in a national cemetery with the vet in the future, you can inter them and later the vet will join them.
- Keep multiple copies of the DD214 and any VA award letters – these will be needed by whomever handles the burial and claims. It’s wise for the veteran to ensure next-of-kin know where these documents are.
- If the veteran had a VA-guaranteed home loan, the surviving spouse might have loan options (like assumption or refinancing). If the vet was being treated by VA and died, the spouse might be able to request an autopsy or investigation if care was an issue (for malpractice claims – separate matter: Section 1151 claims).
- For any debts owed to VA (like overpayments), debts are generally written off when veteran dies (not collected from survivors unless it was joint or fraudulent).
- Surviving children with disabilities who became adults incapable of self-support before 18 can sometimes continue to receive DIC or Survivors Pension in their own right as “helpless child” of the veteran.
- **Plot Allowance**: if burying a veteran in a private cemetery, be sure to apply for the plot allowance if eligible – funeral homes sometimes forget to inform families of this small reimbursement.
- **Honoring Veterans who died long ago**: If you have a family member who was a veteran but never got a VA headstone, you can still request one (for example a Civil War ancestor buried in a private grave). VA will still provide a marker because “**a veteran is entitled to a headstone or marker in any cemetery worldwide**” regardless of time since service ([Veteran Burial Allowance & Benefits: Eligibility and How to Apply](https://www.militarymoney.com/veterans/burial-allowance/#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20circumstances%2C%20a%20veteran,%E2%80%9CTaps%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20a%20gun%20salute)).

## Free and Discounted Services for Veterans

In addition to the core VA benefits, there are numerous **free or discounted services** available to veterans through various federal and partner programs. These range from recreational benefits like free park access to transportation perks. Here are some notable ones:

- **America the Beautiful – National Parks and Federal Lands Pass:** As of Veterans Day 2022, **all U.S. military veterans and Gold Star families are eligible for a free lifetime pass to national parks, wildlife refuges, and other federal recreation sites** ([New lifetime pass available for Military Veterans and Gold Star Families to access public lands - Office of Communications (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/11-8-2022-lifetime-pass.htm#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20,parks%2C%20wildlife%20refuges%2C%20and%20forests)). This **Lifetime Military Pass** waives entrance fees for the veteran (or Gold Star family member) and accompanying passengers in a single vehicle at national parks, national forests, etc. ([New lifetime pass available for Military Veterans and Gold Star Families to access public lands - Office of Communications (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/11-8-2022-lifetime-pass.htm#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20,parks%2C%20wildlife%20refuges%2C%20and%20forests)). You can obtain it by visiting a National Park Service or other federal land site that issues passes, with ID/proof of veteran status (such as a VA ID card or driver’s license with veteran designation).
    - Prior to this, there was a free annual military pass for active duty and a separate Access Pass for disabled. Those still exist, but now the lifetime pass for veterans simplifies things. (Disabled veterans can alternatively get the **Access Pass**, a free lifetime pass that also provides discounts on amenities like camping fees. But since the new lifetime veteran pass covers entry similarly, either works).
- **State Park Access:** Many states offer free or discounted entry to state parks for veterans, especially disabled veterans. (Not a federal program, but worth checking your state – e.g., some states give a free annual state park pass to any veteran or specifically to 100% disabled or POW veterans).
- **Space-Available Flights (Space-A):** As mentioned earlier, **100% service-connected disabled veterans (and certain caregivers and dependents when accompanying) can fly Space-A on military aircraft** on a **stand-by, seats-available basis** ([AMC Space Available Travel Page - Air Mobility Command - AF.mil](https://www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Space-Available-Travel-Page/#:~:text=AF,traveling)) ([Disabled Veterans can fly Space Available Flights for free - VA News](https://news.va.gov/60642/eligibility-disabled-veterans-space-available-flights/#:~:text=When%20congress%20signed%20the%20John,Aviation%20Units%20have%20flights%20available)). This includes flights within the continental U.S. and directly between CONUS and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or U.S. Virgin Islands ([Disabled Veterans can fly Space Available Flights for free - VA News](https://news.va.gov/60642/eligibility-disabled-veterans-space-available-flights/#:~:text=When%20congress%20signed%20the%20John,Aviation%20Units%20have%20flights%20available)). You need a DoD-issued ID card (for the vet, that’s the Tan DD2765 card which indicates 100% DAV). You sign up through the Air Mobility Command. It’s a great benefit if you have a flexible schedule and want to travel at minimal cost (typically a small head tax fee on some flights).
- **TSA Pre✓® for Veterans:** While not automatically free for all vets, some veterans qualify:
    - **Wounded Warriors:** Through TSA’s program, veterans who are **disabled or amputees** can get expedited screening. Also, those with 100% disability can often use the TSA Pre✓ line by showing their ID (TSA has a Wounded Warrior program that often coordinates with USO etc. to assist severely injured vets).
    - **DoD ID card holders (Retirees, active, Guard/Reserve)** can use their DoD ID number as a Known Traveler Number for TSA PreCheck. For other veterans, currently TSA PreCheck isn’t free (cost is $78 for 5 years), but some credit cards will reimburse that fee and some airlines occasionally have promotions. (There was a Bill to extend free PreCheck to all 100% disabled vets – check current status as of 2025).
- **Military Hospitals/Commissary Use:** Under the 2019 law change, veterans with any service-connected rating and their caregivers can access **commissaries and exchanges** and **MWR** (which includes recreation centers, base theaters, etc.) ([The 2025 Benefits List for Veterans and Dependents | Hill & Ponton, P.A.](https://www.hillandponton.com/additional-benefits-for-100-percent-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=,are%20not%20eligible%20for%20TRICARE)). While not “free” (you still pay for your groceries), shopping at these facilities can save money (no sales tax, generally cheaper goods). Also base **Medical facility privileges**: Actually, non-retiree veterans generally cannot get routine care at military hospitals after service (they rely on VA or private). However, those with DoD ID might access base pharmacies in some cases. But as a free service – sometimes base pharmacies will fill medications for 100% disabled vets if they have a military ID (this varies by base policy and if the vet has TRICARE/CHAMPVA etc.).
- **Recreation and Morale:** Many bases have **recreational lodging and campgrounds** open to veterans with DoD IDs. For instance, **MWR recreation facilities** like campgrounds, cabins, etc. If you can get on base (via the extended ID card eligibility for certain vets), you can often use these. There are also military-affiliated resorts (e.g., **Shades of Green at Disney World**, **Hale Koa in Hawaii**, **Edelweiss Lodge in Germany**) – these are open to active/retired and certain other vets (100% disabled are allowed as well). They offer deluxe accommodations at moderate prices (no tax). So effectively a discounted resort stay.
- **Free Tax Preparation:** Veterans (and active duty) can get free tax help through:
    - **VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance)** and **TCE (Tax Counseling for the Elderly)** programs often have sites focusing on military and vets (sometimes at VA facilities or vet centers).
    - **MilTax** is a free tax prep software and support from Military OneSource, available to active duty, Guard/Reserve, and veterans up to 1 year post-separation (not lifelong for all vets, though some vets have reported continued access).
    - Many major tax software companies offer free editions for simple returns or discounts for veterans.
- **Free Transportation for Health Care:** If a veteran needs help getting to a VA medical appointment, the **DAV operates a Volunteer Transportation Network** offering free rides in many areas. Also, some regions have county van services for vets. Additionally, veterans in certain cities might get transit incentives – e.g., Washington DC gives veterans free rides on city buses/rail with a special ID card, etc. Check your city/state (not federal).
    - On a related note, **Amtrak** offers a 10% discount for active duty and up to 5 family members traveling with them. They have at times extended it to veterans (currently it’s active duty only, but Amtrak does offer some veteran promotions occasionally) ([Veteran discounts available year round - VA News](https://news.va.gov/85765/veteran-discounts-available-year-round/#:~:text=Amtrak%20Active,ahead%20of%20the%20ticket%20line)).
- **Legal and Notary Services:** Many states authorize **free notary services** for veterans at county offices. Also, some bar associations run free **legal clinics for veterans** for certain issues (discharge upgrades, benefit appeals, housing, etc.). Not federal but widely available.
- **Veterans Day / Memorial Day Perks:** Every Veterans Day (Nov 11) hundreds of restaurants and businesses offer free meals, haircuts, car washes, and other services to veterans. While these are promotional, they are widely used. Additionally, National Parks have free entry for all visitors on Veterans Day regardless of veteran status, etc.
- **Cell Phone Plans & Tech:** Most major wireless carriers offer a discount for veterans (e.g., AT&T, Verizon ~15% off; T-Mobile has a Magenta Military plan with lower rates). Apple and other tech companies have veterans storefronts (Apple usually ~10% off products for vets year-round). Microsoft too. These require verifying your veteran status (often through ID.me).
- **Shopping Discounts:** Many retailers give **year-round military/veteran discounts** – Lowe’s and Home Depot both have **10% off** for veterans year-round (Home Depot’s requires you to sign up via their app with proof of service; Lowe’s also has a signup) ([Everyday Military Discount - Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/l/about/honor-our-military#:~:text=Lowe%27s%20offers%20a%2010,currently%20serving%20our%20country)) ([Military Discount & Veterans Deals - The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/c/military#:~:text=Military%20Discount%20%26%20Veterans%20Deals,maximum%20yearly%20discount%20of%20%24400)). Other retail discounts exist at places like Under Armour, certain hotels, theme parks, etc. **Target** has a 10% off one-time coupon for vets each November. **Disney** offers discounted hotel and tickets for active/retired (and recently extended to 100% disabled) under the Armed Forces Salute – veterans without those categories aren’t eligible for the steepest Disney deals, but Disneyland now offers a veterans ticket in off-season.
- **Recreational Equipment and Tickets:** 
    - **Veterans Tickets Foundation (Vet Tix)** provides **free event tickets** (just a small delivery fee) to veterans, service members, and Gold Star families, to concerts, sports, etc. ([Veterans receive free concert, sporting event, family activity tickets - VA News](https://news.va.gov/63724/vettix-and-va-official-partnership/#:~:text=VetTix%20provides%20free%20tickets%20to,and%20receive%20their%20free%20tickets)). You sign up on VetTix.org, verify service, and request tickets for events in your area. Great way to enjoy outings as a family with minimal cost.
    - **Outdoor Gear Discounts:** Many outdoor brands (North Face, Yeti, etc.) have some military/veteran discount (some via third-party like GovX or ID.me verification). Even **National Park Service** gift shops often give 10% to veterans.
- **Academic Testing and Certifications:** Some testing fee waivers exist. E.g., ETS (which runs GRE, Praxis) offers vouchers for military. Some IT companies offer free certification attempts for vets (Cisco had a program). Also, under GI Bill, **VA will reimburse fees for credentialing tests or admissions tests** (like SAT, LSAT, etc.) – while not free upfront, it means you get the money back using your GI Bill entitlement.
- **Library Services:** If you have a DoD ID, you can use base libraries. But also, the **Library of Congress** has the **Veterans History Project** where vets can contribute their oral histories. Some libraries have veteran hiring preferences or fine forgiveness events for vets (small perks).
- **Emergency Assistance:** Organizations like **Operation Homefront** may provide free emergency financial aid (for example, grants for repairs, etc.) to veterans in need (usually post-9/11 wounded).
- **Rehabilitation and Hobbies:** Some nonprofits offer **free programs like scuba diving certification for disabled vets** (e.g., Soldiers Undertaking Disabled Scuba), **free flights** (Veterans Airlift Command provides free air transportation to medical appointments for post-9/11 combat wounded and their families). Also, many national and local charities host **hunting/fishing trips** for veterans at no cost (like Wounded Warriors in Action, etc.).
- **Veterans Day in Retail:** Aside from freebies, several businesses like **Great Clips** often offer a free haircut on Veterans Day (or a voucher to use later). It’s good to compile a personal list each year or check reputable sources that list Veterans Day deals.

**Note:** For many discounts, you may need a form of veteran ID. A driver’s license with veteran designation, a VA ID card, a retired military ID, or even a DD-214 copy (though not recommended to carry the original around regularly) can be used. The VA issues a Veteran ID Card (VIC) for honorably discharged vets which is useful just for proof at private businesses (not for official benefits).

## Military and Veteran Discounts

In addition to the free services and benefits above, **many businesses offer ongoing discounts to veterans and military personnel**. While we can’t list every single one, here’s a breakdown of common categories and examples of widely available veteran discounts:

**Retail Stores:**
- **Home Improvement Stores:** **Lowe’s** and **Home Depot** both have **10% military discounts** for veterans, active duty, and spouses year-round on most items ([Everyday Military Discount - Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/l/about/honor-our-military#:~:text=Lowe%27s%20offers%20a%2010,currently%20serving%20our%20country)) ([Military Discount & Veterans Deals - The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/c/military#:~:text=Military%20Discount%20%26%20Veterans%20Deals,maximum%20yearly%20discount%20of%20%24400)). (Home Depot’s policy requires you to register online for a virtual ID; Lowe’s requires you to sign up for their “MyLowe’s” and verify service). There may be annual spending caps (Home Depot currently limits to $400 discount per year).
- **Clothing & Apparel:** Many clothing retailers offer 10-15% off for veterans. For example, **Under Armour** (10% off), **Nike** (sometimes 10% off with verification), **Columbia Sportswear** (10% off), **Foot Locker** (military/vet VIP program). 
- **Department Stores:** **Target** gives a 10% off *coupon* to vets and active duty annually (usually around Veterans Day, can be used once). **Kohl’s** has “Military Mondays” in some regions with 15% off in-store for vets. Always ask – many stores don’t advertise but will apply a discount if asked with ID.
- **Groceries:** **Costco** often has promotions for new veteran members (e.g., shop card bonus). **Sam’s Club** waives joining fees or has gift cards for vets who join. Regular grocery chains typically don’t have veteran discounts, but some local farmer’s markets or vendors do.
- **Technology:** **Apple** offers a special **veterans online store** – usually a standard 10% off most products for verified vets (this can save a lot on expensive items). **Dell** and **HP** also have military discounts or portals. **Microsoft** offers 10% off select products for vets. 
- **Cell Phones:** All major carriers have veteran plans. **Verizon’s Veterans Plan** gives a discount on their Unlimited plans (typically $10 off one line, $25 off for 2 lines, etc.). **AT&T** offers 25% off on some plans for military/vets. **T-Mobile** has Magenta Military which is significantly cheaper than regular Magenta (available to vets).
- **Travel & Hotels:** 
   - **Airlines:** Most U.S. airlines offer free baggage for active duty (and some for dependents) – for veterans not on active duty, generally no across-the-board baggage benefit (except with certain statuses or if disabled with specific equipment). But airlines do offer occasional fare discounts or free companion tickets for vets through promotions or charities. **American Airlines** has a 5% discount for veterans through their VetRewards (a paid membership service – not free to join though). 
   - **Hotels:** Many hotel chains have “Government/Military” rates. Veterans can often qualify for these rates (especially if they have a veteran ID or when booking they won’t always verify active status). These rates can be quite lower than standard. For example, **IHG (Holiday Inn)**, **Hilton**, **Marriott**, **Choice Hotels** all have military rates. Some require active/retired ID, but many include veterans – check terms. Also, **Bed and Breakfast for Vets** is a program where some B&Bs offer free stays around Veterans Day. 
   - **Rental Cars:** Most rental car companies offer government rates for official travel (with orders), but many have special discounts for leisure travel for vets via USAA or other portals. USAA members (which include many vets) get discounted rates with certain rental companies. 
   - **Cruises:** Some cruise lines offer military rates or onboard credits. E.g., **Carnival** has military fares on select sailings, **Disney Cruise Line** offers special military rates on some cruises (veterans with honorable discharges are eligible on a limited basis, often for off-peak sailings). **Princess** and **Royal Caribbean** sometimes offer onboard spending money to vets.
   - **Theme Parks:** **Walt Disney World** and **Disneyland** have the **Armed Forces Salute** – deeply discounted tickets for active and retired (and 100% DAV, POW spouses). Veterans who aren’t retired/disabled can still often get slightly discounted tickets through MWR or AAA but the Salute (like 4-days Park Hopper for ~$330) is only for those categories. **Universal Studios** has a Veterans discount ticket (offered through ITT offices or their website), not as steep as active duty but some savings.
   - **Amtrak:** As noted, 10% off for active duty and dependents; veterans specifically get 10% on select routes and times (like some state-supported routes).
- **Restaurants:** Many restaurants give a percentage off year-round if you show a military or veteran ID – typically 10% (examples: **IHOP**, **Denny’s**, **Golden Corral**, **Buffalo Wild Wings** to name a few). It varies by location though. On Veterans Day, virtually every chain has a free meal or menu item for veterans. Also many offer something on Memorial Day or Independence Day, but Veterans Day is biggest. **Starbucks** often gives free coffee on Veterans Day (and has historically given a discount on purchases if you have a Starbucks Veteran's card design).
- **Entertainment:** 
   - **Movie Theaters:** Many theaters (Regal, AMC, Cinemark) have military pricing (which vets can often use). That usually is a couple dollars off a ticket.
   - **Sporting Events:** On regular days, teams sometimes have military discount tickets (often for active duty though). However, via **VetTix** veterans can get free tickets ([Veterans receive free concert, sporting event, family activity tickets - VA News](https://news.va.gov/63724/vettix-and-va-official-partnership/#:~:text=VetTix%20provides%20free%20tickets%20to,and%20receive%20their%20free%20tickets)). Also Minor League teams frequently have military nights with free or cheap tickets for vets.
   - **Museums & Zoos:** A huge number of museums, zoos, aquariums offer discounted or free entry for veterans, especially on patriotic holidays or year-round. There’s also the **Blue Star Museums** program (free entry to hundreds of museums in summer for active duty and families). Some extend it to veterans, some not – always ask. For example, **SeaWorld/Busch Gardens** parks have a Waves of Honor program: one free admission per year for active and up to 3 dependents, and now also a single free admission for veterans (with guests) on a promotional basis some years.
   - **National Park Pass** (already mentioned under free services).
- **Professional Services:**
   - **Home Loans:** While not exactly a discount, using the VA Home Loan benefit saves money via no PMI and competitive rates.
   - **Banking:** Many banks have accounts with no fees for military. **Chase** waives monthly fees for veterans on certain accounts. **PNC** and **Bank of America** have military banking programs. Credit unions like **Navy Federal** and **USAA** are catered to military/vets with generally better rates/services (not “discounts” per se but advantages).
   - **Insurance:** Some insurers give a vet discount. **Geico** has a 15% discount in certain states for military (active/retired). USAA insurance is often a good deal for vets (and their families can use it).
   - **Amazon Prime:** They’ve occasionally offered a Veterans Day promo where a year of Prime is discounted (like $79 instead of $119) for veterans. Not constant, but keep an eye out around November.
   - **Software:** Microsoft Office 365 is discounted via the Home Use Program for some vets (if you have a .mil or certain .gov email). But also Google and others have free options anyway.

**How to Access Discounts:** Typically, you need some proof of service:
- The easiest is often a **state-issued ID with Veteran designation** (most states offer this on driver’s license or ID card if you show your DD-214 once).
- The **VA Veteran ID Card (VIC)** which you can apply for online – it has your photo and says you’re a Veteran (honorable). Many retailers accept this as ID.
- A **military retiree ID** or **100% DAV ID** works obviously but not everyone has those.
- Some use their **DD-214** but that’s not convenient or advisable to carry daily (plus some places won’t know how to interpret it quickly).
- Some companies verify through **services like ID.me or SheerID** on their websites (e.g., Apple’s online discount store or Verizon’s validation). 
- There’s also a **Veterans Advantage** subscription (VetRewards) which is a paid card that partners with some companies for discounts, but you can usually get the same deals without paying for a card by directly asking or using free verification.

**Caution:** Always ask kindly if a business offers a veteran discount. Many small businesses do, even if not advertised. However, be understanding if they don’t; discounts are a privilege, not a right. Also, sometimes the employee might not know – so be patient or ask a manager.

**Stay Updated:** Websites like MilitaryBenefits.info, Military.com, and blogs often compile updated lists of discounts and freebies for veterans around Veterans Day and year-round. The VA blog VAntage Point runs a yearly list of Veterans Day freebies as well.

**Sources:**

## Nonprofit & Community-Based Resources

In addition to government programs, a vast ecosystem of **nonprofit organizations, community groups, and online communities** support veterans and their families. These range from national congressionally chartered Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to grassroots peer-support groups. Here are some major categories and examples:

### Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs)
These organizations provide free services (like claims assistance) and advocate for veterans. Many are congressionally chartered and have trained **Service Officers** accredited by VA.
- **Disabled American Veterans (DAV):** Helps veterans file VA claims and provides representation. DAV offices and volunteers (often located at VA regional offices and medical centers) will help any veteran (not just DAV members) with paperwork and appeals ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=what%20to%20do%20after%20you,get%20your%20rating)). DAV also runs a nationwide transportation network giving vets rides to medical appointments.
- **Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW):** Aside from its local posts (camaraderie, community service), VFW has national service officers offering benefits assistance. They also have an **Unmet Needs** program providing emergency financial grants to military/vet families and they sponsor scholarships (Voice of Democracy, etc. for students).
- **American Legion:** Also has service officers and a wide array of programs for veterans, youth (Boys State), community events, etc. They help with claims and run temporary financial assistance for veterans with children.
- **AMVETS:** Offers claims help and runs programs like career centers. Also active in legislative advocacy for veterans.
- **Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA):** Focuses on Vietnam-era issues (Agent Orange, etc.) – they provide benefits counseling and run outreach for older vets.
- **Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA):** Specializes in helping veterans with spinal cord injuries or diseases. They have expert service officers who often help any vet with a serious disability, and also focus on accessibility rights, adaptive sports, etc.
- **Student Veterans of America (SVA):** Not a VSO for claims, but a network of student veteran chapters at colleges, advocating and providing support for vets in higher education (study groups, leadership, pushing schools for veteran-friendly policies).
- **Gold Star Wives**, **Gold Star Mothers:** Support networks for survivors. They sometimes help with advocacy and connecting widows to resources like DIC (they were instrumental in DIC improvements).
- **Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH):** Their service officers assist all vets, not just Purple Heart recipients.
- **Team Red, White & Blue (Team RWB):** A newer nonprofit focusing on enriching veterans’ lives through physical and social activities. They have local chapters with weekly fitness events (runs, rucks, yoga) and social gatherings. Great for transitioning younger vets to connect.
- **Team Rubicon:** A veteran-led disaster response organization. Engages veterans in continued service by deploying them to disaster areas to do relief work (chainsaw crews, mucking out flooded homes, etc.). It provides a sense of purpose and community.
- **The Mission Continues:** Organizes community service projects in under-resourced communities, tapping veterans as volunteers and even as platoon leaders for sustained projects.
- **Wounded Warrior Project (WWP):** Offers programs for post-9/11 wounded/disabled vets – including mental health workshops (Project Odyssey), benefits advocacy, peer support, and some independent life programs. WWP has resources and also connections to private care networks (Warrior Care Network for PTSD/TBI).
- **Semper Fi & America’s Fund:** Provides direct financial assistance and programs for critically wounded, ill, and injured service members and families (originally Marine-focused, now all services).
- **Fisher House Foundation:** Builds **Fisher Houses** (like comfort homes) at major military and VA hospitals where families of hospitalized veterans can stay for free. Also runs **Hero Miles** (donated frequent flyer miles to fly families to bedside) and **Hotels for Heroes**.
- **Gary Sinise Foundation:** Has programs like R.I.S.E. (building specially adapted smart homes for severely wounded), relief for Gold Star families, and community events (he is known for concerts for troops).
- **TAPS (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors):** Provides grief counseling, survivor seminars, and care to anyone who lost a military loved one. They have good resources for widows and children (Good Grief Camps).
- **Blinded Veterans Association (BVA):** Specifically for visually impaired vets, offering advocacy and peer support.
- **Category-specific Orgs:** e.g., **Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)** – advocacy and support particularly for post-9/11 vets (they have a Quick Reaction Force case management for vets in need). **Modern Military Association of America (MMAA)** (formerly OutServe/SLDN and AMPA) – supports LGBTQ+ vets and service members. **Minority Veterans of America (MVA)** – builds inclusive community for vets from minority backgrounds.
  
**Why connect with VSOs?** Even if you don’t hang out at the post canteen, these organizations have *expertise* and a mission to help. For instance, if you want to file a VA claim or appeal, having an accredited VSO rep (like DAV or VFW) can greatly help navigate it ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=what%20to%20do%20after%20you,get%20your%20rating)). They often know the system and can track your claim’s progress. They also collectively advocate in Congress for things like expanded benefits (most major improvements, like the Agent Orange Act, new presumptives, caregiver expansions, have heavy VSO involvement). And on a local level, posts do community service, color guards, and have scholarships and contests for kids.

### Online Communities and Veteran-Run Websites

The internet has allowed veterans to share information and support each other in valuable ways:
- **Reddit (r/Veterans, r/VeteransBenefits):** These subreddits act as crowdsourced knowledge bases. For example, **r/VeteransBenefits** has a comprehensive **Wiki/Knowledge Base** containing guides on VA claims, appeals, common questions, etc., compiled by experienced community members ([We have a Knowledge Base (Wiki)! : r/VeteransBenefits - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qni2v6/we_have_a_knowledge_base_wiki/#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20Knowledge%20Base,on%20all%20things%20Veterans%20Benefits)). They also have megathreads where vets ask questions about anything from “what does this letter from VA mean” to “tips for C&P exams.” The community is generally helpful (though remember they’re not official VA advisors). **r/Veterans** is more general – discussion and advice on all aspects of life after military (jobs, VA, mental health, etc.). The **community-driven FAQs and info** can complement official sources and often explain things in plain language.
- **HadIt.com**: A longstanding forum where veterans (especially from the Gulf War & Vietnam eras) discuss VA disability claims, share success stories, and case law. It’s moderated by knowledgeable veterans who often cite regulations or their experiences to help others. It’s a bit old-school interface, but lots of gems of info, e.g. personal experiences with certain conditions or dealing with the BVA.
- **Stateside Legal**: A website with resources for low-income vets, including a searchable guide of legal help by state, and self-help guides for things like discharge upgrades or VA overpayment issues.
- **Hill & Ponton Blog / Other Law Firm Blogs**: Several veteran law firms (Hill & Ponton, CCK Law, etc.) maintain blogs with explanatory articles on VA law and process, which can be quite informative about things like how TDIU works or explaining new presumptive conditions. They often break down complex topics.
- **Facebook Groups:** There are countless Facebook groups for veterans. Some are general “Veterans” groups, others are specific (by unit, by era, by hobby). For benefits specifically, there are groups like “VA Disability Claims Support” where vets ask questions and share knowledge. Always be cautious about privacy (don’t post your SSN or claim # etc.), but these can be quick places to gauge what others are experiencing.
- **YouTube Vets:** Some veterans have YouTube channels or podcasts (for example, **Team CTI** (Combat Craig) and others) discussing strategies for VA claims. While one should be cautious and verify info, these often explain in relatable terms and bring up points to consider. The **VA’s own YouTube** also posts helpful webinars (they do periodic “Office Hours” explaining new programs).
- **Reddit's /r/MilitaryFinance**: Good for questions on military pay, VA comp, or general finance as a vet.
- **Stack Exchange (Veterans sub)**: Not as active as Reddit, but some Q&As exist.
- **Discord servers**: There are now veteran channels on Discord where you can chat in real-time with fellow vets on various topics (some are connected to Reddit groups or gaming communities).

### Specialized Nonprofits & Programs

- **Combat Stress / PTSD Support:** Besides the big ones like WWP and VA, there are small retreats and therapies: **Save A Warrior** (hosts 1-week “war detox” programs), **Heroic Hearts Project** (advocates for psychedelic therapy for PTSD – even organizes retreats abroad for vets), **Boulder Crest Foundation** (runs PTG-based programs for vets and families).
- **Service Dogs:** Organizations like **Pets for Vets**, **K9s for Warriors**, **Patriot Paws** provide service dogs to veterans with PTSD or mobility issues at no cost. There is often a waiting list but many success stories.
- **Employment/Transition Nonprofits:** (some mentioned in employment section) – **Hire Heroes USA** (free career coaching), **American Corporate Partners (ACP)** (free long-term mentorship in career), **Coding bootcamps for vets** (e.g., Code Platoon, Vets Who Code).
- **Adaptive Sports:** **Adaptive Sports USA**, **Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride**, **VA Adaptive Sports** (the VA Winter Sports Clinic, Wheelchair Games, etc.), and nonprofits like **Adaptive Training Foundation** in TX – all help seriously injured vets engage in sports, which improves health and confidence. Also, **Operation Warfighter** (DoD program) for recovering service members to intern at federal agencies, and **Caregiver support** groups for families (like **Elizabeth Dole Foundation**).
- **Financial Coaching:** **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** has a program placing free financial coaches at some VA facilities to help veterans with budgeting, credit, etc. **Operation: Veteran Finance** or local credit unions might have education programs.
- **Women Veterans:** There are groups focusing on women vets’ unique needs – **Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN)**, **Women Veterans Network (WoVeN)** peer groups, the VA’s Women Veterans Call Center, etc. Nonprofits like **Final Salute** help homeless women vets, and **Pink Ops** focusing on women vet entrepreneurs.
- **Scholarships for Families:** beyond Chapter 35 and Fry, hundreds of private scholarships exist: **Folds of Honor** gives scholarships to spouses and children of fallen or disabled (rated 90-100%) vets. **ThanksUSA**, **Children of Fallen Patriots**, etc. Many VSOs (DAV, American Legion, etc.) also have scholarship contests.

### Community and Peer Support

- **Local Veterans Coalitions:** Many counties have a Veterans Council or coalition bringing together the VSO reps, VA reps, nonprofits, etc., to collaborate on helping local vets (one-stop events, stand downs for homeless vets where free services provided). Check if your county has a Veterans Service Office.
- **Meetups and Social groups:** On Meetup.com or Facebook you might find informal vet groups like a veterans hiking club, or a breakfast meetup at a local diner weekly for vets.
- **Volunteer Opportunities:** Sometimes volunteering with veteran orgs can help you as well, through connecting with others and adding purpose. For example, joining your local American Legion to volunteer with youth or poppy distribution; or volunteering at a VA hospital (many have volunteer programs to escort patients, etc. – good for older vets to give back).

**Using These Resources:**
- To find local groups or services, one can use tools like **Unite Us/America Serves** networks (in some states, a coordinated referral network for vet services), or simply ask at a **Vet Center** or VA Community Resource and Referral Center.
- The **VA.gov directory** lists **VSOs that have representatives accredited with VA**, with contact info – you can reach out to one for claims help ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=what%20to%20do%20after%20you,get%20your%20rating)).
- **Network with other veterans.** Often, word-of-mouth is how you discover a small nonprofit that might be perfect for your need (for example, a veteran friend mentions a free hunting weekend he did with a group and invites you next time).
- The **Vet Center** community room bulletin board or the VA medical center’s **Veterans Resource office** may have brochures for local organizations and events.

**Online Knowledge Repositories:**
- **r/VeteransBenefits Knowledge Base** – as cited, full of guides on everything from navigating eBenefits to understanding evaluation criteria ([We have a Knowledge Base (Wiki)! : r/VeteransBenefits - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qni2v6/we_have_a_knowledge_base_wiki/#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20Knowledge%20Base,on%20all%20things%20Veterans%20Benefits)).
- **PADD (Public Access to Disability Data)** – not a nonprofit, but a site by a volunteer that aggregated BVA decision data which can be searched (some use to see how cases like theirs were decided).
- **Wikipedia’s “List of veterans organizations”** – surprisingly thorough.

**Veteran Peer Hotlines & Support:**
- Beyond the Crisis Line, there are hotlines like **Vets4Warriors** – 1-855-838-8255 – a 24/7 peer support line run by veterans at Rutgers University, not for crisis but for any struggling vet who wants to talk things out with another vet.
- **Objective Zero** app, as mentioned earlier, connects vets to peer supporters instantly via chat or call.

**Conclusion:** The combination of government benefits and these community resources forms a robust safety net. A veteran might utilize VA healthcare and compensation, but also lean on a DAV service officer for a claim, attend an American Legion holiday party for camaraderie, get a free gym membership through Team RWB meetups, find answers on Reddit, and vacation with a discounted park pass and VetTix tickets. It’s this patchwork of support that can greatly enhance quality of life for veterans and their families.

## Tools for Navigating VA Processes

Dealing with the VA (and other military/veteran systems) can be bureaucratic. Thankfully, there are several tools, websites, and organizations to help veterans navigate these processes:

### VA.gov – Your Online Hub

**VA.gov** is the primary website for VA services. In recent years, it has consolidated many formerly separate sites (eBenefits, Vets.gov, MyHealtheVet) under one umbrella with a single sign-on. Key features once you login with a verified account (using **DS Logon, ID.me, Login.gov, or MyHealtheVet credentials**):
- **Check Claim Status:** You can see the status of compensation or pension claims and appeals ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=Manage%20your%20Veterans%20disability%20benefits)), including historical claims. It shows current stage (“Evidence gathering” etc.) and uploads of decision letters.
- **File Claims or Appeals:** You can initiate a new claim for compensation (21-526EZ) fully online, upload evidence, and submit it. You can also file Decision Reviews (HLR and Supplemental) online. Appeals to the Board (Notice of Disagreement) currently require a PDF upload via VA.gov.
- **View Benefit Letters:** You can download your VA **Benefit Summary Letter** (which shows your disability ratings), Civil service preference letter, Commissary letter (for 100% DAV), etc., from VA.gov ([VA Disability Compensation | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/disability/#:~:text=,your%20direct%20deposit%20information%20online)).
- **Manage Direct Deposit and Contact Info:** Update your address, phone, email, and direct deposit for VA benefits online – this covers compensation/pension and education deposits.
- **VA Health Appointments & Records:** Through a linked MyHealtheVet connection or directly, you can manage appointments, see results, secure message your providers, and refill prescriptions.
- **Apply for Benefits:** VA.gov has online applications for health care (10-10EZ), education benefits (22-1990), VR&E (28-1900), VA Home Loan COE, and even burial pre-need eligibility.
- **Track Appeals:** There’s a separate tool for checking Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BVA) status which will show if your appeal is waiting for a hearing, etc.
- **Insurance and Loans:** You can manage VA life insurance policies (like VGLI and VALife) and check your VA home loan COE status ([VA Housing Assistance | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/#:~:text=,depending%20on%20your%20loan%20type)).

If you haven’t made a VA.gov account, do so – it streamlines many interactions with VA.

### eBenefits (legacy portal)

**eBenefits** was the original self-service portal for veterans (joint VA/DoD). Much of its functionality moved to VA.gov as of 2018-2020. However, some features still redirect to eBenefits:
- Checking your **Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement** and using the **GI Bill Comparison Tool**.
- The **military service records** section, and some personalized employment resources.
- But for most things (claims, letters), VA.gov covers it now. eBenefits will likely be fully phased out. If you try to access something on eBenefits, it might push you to VA.gov login.

### My HealtheVet and VA Health Apps

**MyHealtheVet (MHV)** is VA’s patient portal for health. With a premium account (which you can now get by verifying identity online via DS Logon or in-person at VA), you can:
- **Secure Message** your VA health providers – send non-urgent questions and they will reply typically within a few days.
- **Refill Prescriptions** and track shipments.
- **View lab results, vitals, notes** (if you opt into VA’s OpenNotes, you can read what your doctor wrote in your visit notes).
- **Download health records** (Blue Button) – you can get a summary of care or specific date range.
- **Schedule VA Appointments:** At some facilities, you can request or schedule appointments online (they also have a newer tool called VA Online Scheduling).
- MHV is integrated with a **VA Health Chat** in some regions for virtual urgent care.

VA is also developing the **VA Health and Benefits mobile app** – which is available on iOS/Android. This app (by VA) can:
- Show your claim status and current benefit rates,
- Display your digital VA ID card,
- Let you secure message doctors,
- Refill meds, see appointments, and more.

### DS Logon / ID.me / Login.gov – Access Credentials

To use VA (and DoD) online systems, you need an account:
- **DS Logon:** A DoD Self-Service Logon. Many veterans have one from their transition (through eBenefits). A DS Logon Premium allows access to VA and DoD sites. If you don’t have one, you can request it (requires identity proof).
- **ID.me:** A third-party identity provider VA uses. Many have used ID.me to verify for some VA service. It uses document upload or credit bureau questions for verification. Once verified, you can use that to login to VA.gov. (Note: ID.me faced some controversies, and VA is encouraging switching to Login.gov).
- **Login.gov:** A government-run secure login used by many federal agencies. VA.gov now allows sign-in via Login.gov (which if you set up with identity verification, works similarly to ID.me). It’s a good idea to set up a Login.gov account with your verified info as it may become the standard.
- **MyHealtheVet credentials:** If you had MHV account, you could use those to login to VA.gov as well after linking.

Pro Tip: Link your accounts – you can go to VA.gov account settings and ensure your DS Logon, ID.me, etc., are connected so any can authenticate you.

### GI Bill Tools

For education benefits:
- **GI Bill Comparison Tool:** On VA’s site, you input a school and it shows how much tuition Post-9/11 covers, what the housing allowance is in that area, if the school is Yellow Ribbon (and how many slots), and any complaints or cautions on that school ([GI Bill And Other Education Benefit Eligibility | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility/#:~:text=Also%2C%20if%20you%27re%20in%20the,or)).
- **WEAMS Institution Search:** A VA tool listing all approved education/training facilities for GI Bill – useful to see if a program is VA-approved.
- **VA Education Call Center:** 1-888-GIBILL-1 – while not an app, calling can resolve payment issues or entitlement questions. They also recently launched an “Ask a Question” system upgrade for education benefits on the VA website for online queries.
- **STEM Scholarship application** is via an online portal for those eligible (the Rogers STEM Scholarship for extra months).
- **VR&E’s Online Portal (e-VA)** – VR&E has started using a platform called e-VA (not to be confused with eBenefits) for participants to communicate with counselors, but for application, use VA.gov.

### Others Tools and Support

- **County VSOs:** Many states have County Veterans Service Officers. These are local government or state employees trained to help vets with claims and local resources. They are essentially like free consultants. Finding your local CVSO (via your state veterans affairs department) can be a great first step if you prefer in-person help navigating benefits.
- **Vet Centers:** I mention again because beyond counseling, Vet Center staff can guide you to other VA programs and help with referral. They often have information on community resources like local food pantries or employment leads specifically for vets. They might host financial education classes or group sessions on navigating civilian life.
- **VA Welcome Kit:** VA has a downloadable **Welcome Kit** that in plain language outlines how to access various benefits and provides the phone numbers/websites needed. It’s broken into sections (health care, school, etc.) and is a good “at a glance” reference for new veterans or those newly engaging with VA ([[PDF] Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents Survivors and Caregivers](https://department.va.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Federal-Benefits-for-Veterans-Dependents-and-Survivors.pdf#:~:text=Caregivers%20department,depth.%20General)).
- **White House VA Hotline:** This is a 24/7 line at 1-855-948-2311 that any veteran or family member can call to raise concerns or ask questions about VA. It’s staffed mostly by veterans and it answers questions or takes complaints (with a goal to resolve issues). If you feel stuck or not getting through at your local VA, calling this line can sometimes escalate the issue.
- **VA Mobile Apps:** 
   - **VA Health and Benefits** (mentioned).
   - **Annie App:** VA’s text messaging service that sends you reminders or check-ins (like med reminders or mental health coping texts).
   - **COVID and other specific apps** (like PTSD Coach, CPT Coach, etc. for mental health self-help).
- **Virtual Assistant (Chatbot) on VA.gov:** If you go to VA’s website, there’s a chat icon – that AI chat can answer common queries or direct you to info pages.
- **Board of Veterans’ Appeals Docket search:** If you have an appeal at Board, you can search by your docket number to see roughly which cases have been decided around it.
- **Federal Register and VA Policy Manuals:** For the hardcore researcher, VA’s **M21-1 Adjudication Manual** is online (used to be hidden, now public via VA’s website). It details how raters adjudicate claims. Also **38 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 3 & 4** contains the rules and rating schedules. These are dense but the info is there if you want to see exactly what criteria your claim was judged by.
- **Congressional Liaisons:** If you feel your claim is unjustly delayed or you’re not getting help, contacting your Congressperson’s **veterans caseworker** can sometimes prod VA (they’ll send an inquiry on your behalf). Use sparingly and for significant issues, but it’s an available tool for escalation.

- **DoD Records Tools:** 
  - **milConnect** website is where you can download your DD-214 (if recent) and manage DoD benefits like SGLI, transfer of GI Bill while active, etc. (Login with DS Logon).
  - **eMILPO / iPERMS** for Army records or **BOL** for Navy – less relevant after service, but if you need to retrieve something like an old eval, you might access through archives or request from National Archives.
  - **National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) eVetRecs:** to request older service records if needed for claims or family genealogy.

- **Career Tools (from DOL):** 
  - **O*NET OnLine Military Crosswalk** – to see what civilian careers align with your MOS.
  - **USAJOBS Resume Builder** – helps format a federal resume properly (which is way longer and detailed than civilian).
  
- **Financial/Medical Tools for elderly vets or survivors:**
  - If applying for VA pension/A&A, using a **VA accredited attorney or claims agent** can help because those applications can be complex with asset calculations. Check VA’s accreditation search to avoid unaccredited predatory “pension poachers”.
  - **Medicare and TRICARE:** If you retired or are 100% DAV, understanding how Medicare interacts with VA and CHAMPVA or TRICARE is important. Tools include Medicare Plan Finder, and Tricare’s online tools for finding providers. Also, **MyMedicare.gov** if you dual-use VA and Medicare, coordinate care.

- **Community Resource and Referral Centers (CRRC):** These are VA centers in many cities focusing on homeless veterans and providing one-stop assistance (housing referrals, showers, laundry, social workers). Even if you’re not homeless, they often know a lot about local assistance (like where to get free furniture or emergency help).

By leveraging these tools, veterans can more easily **apply for benefits, track their status, maintain their records, and get help when needed** – effectively cutting through the red tape that often frustrates those unfamiliar with the systems. The key is knowing what’s available and not hesitating to use these resources or ask for help – whether it’s clicking a “Submit” button on VA.gov or reaching out to a fellow vet or VSO for guidance ([We have a Knowledge Base (Wiki)! : r/VeteransBenefits - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qni2v6/we_have_a_knowledge_base_wiki/#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20Knowledge%20Base,on%20all%20things%20Veterans%20Benefits)). The combination of official VA digital tools and community support can make the complex process of accessing benefits much more navigable.
